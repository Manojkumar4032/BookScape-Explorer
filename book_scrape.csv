Focussing on a transcultural history, this book questions the territoriality of historical concepts and offers a narrative, which aims to overcome cultural essentialism by focussing on crossing borders of all kinds. Transcultural History reflects critically on the way history is constructed, asking who formed history in the past and who succeeded in shaping what we call the master narrative. Although trained European historians, the authors aim to present a useful approach to global history, showing first of all how a Eurocentric but universal historiography removed or essentialised certain topics in Asian history. As an empirical discipline, history is based on source material, analysed according to rules resulting from a strong methodological background. This book accesses the global past after World War I, looking at the well known stage of the Paris Peace Conferences, observing the multiplication of new borders and the variety of transgressing institutions, concepts, actors, men and women inventing themselves as global subjects, but sharing a bitter experience with almost all local societies at this time, namely the awareness of having relatives buried in far distant places due to globalised wars.","9783642191961, 3642191967",True,True,184,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yJXGJesdiJIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,12626,INR,12626,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yJXGJesdiJIC&rdid=book-yJXGJesdiJIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2012
BWsnWlfq4jcC,history,History of Shit,,Dominique Laporte,MIT Press,"""A brilliant account of the politics of shit. It will leave you speechless."" Written in Paris after the heady days of student revolt in May 1968 and before the devastation of the AIDS epidemic, History of Shit is emblematic of a wild and adventurous strain of 1970s' theoretical writing that attempted to marry theory, politics, sexuality, pleasure, experimentation, and humor. Radically redefining dialectical thought and post-Marxist politics, it takes an important—and irreverent—position alongside the works of such postmodern thinkers as Foucault, Deleuze, Guattari, and Lyotard. Laporte's eccentric style and ironic sensibility combine in an inquiry that is provocative, humorous, and intellectually exhilarating. Debunking all humanist mythology about the grandeur of civilization, History of Shit suggests instead that the management of human waste is crucial to our identities as modern individuals—including the organization of the city, the rise of the nation-state, the development of capitalism, and the mandate for clean and proper language. Far from rising above the muck, Laporte argues, we are thoroughly mired in it, particularly when we appear our most clean and hygienic. Laporte's style of writing is itself an attack on our desire for ""clean language."" Littered with lengthy quotations and obscure allusions, and adamantly refusing to follow a linear argument, History of Shit breaks the rules and challenges the conventions of ""proper"" academic discourse.","0262621606, 9780262621601",False,True,180,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BWsnWlfq4jcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2002
EHl7juMDKtIC,history,"History, Historians, and Autobiography",,Jeremy D. Popkin,University of Chicago Press,"Though history and autobiography both claim to tell true stories about the past, historians have traditionally rejected first-person accounts as subjective and therefore unreliable. What then, asks Jeremy D. Popkin in History, Historians, and Autobiography, are we to make of the ever-increasing number of professional historians who are publishing stories of their own lives? And how is this recent development changing the nature of history-writing, the historical profession, and the genre of autobiography? Drawing on the theoretical work of contemporary critics of autobiography and the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur, Popkin reads the autobiographical classics of Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams and the memoirs of contemporary historians such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Peter Gay, Jill Ker Conway, and many others, he reveals the contributions historians' life stories make to our understanding of the human experience.

Every year, the Indian film industry produces more than 1,000 feature films; every day, 14 million Indians go to a movie in the country; a billion more people a year buy tickets for Indian movies than for Hollywood ones. The rise of Bombay as the film capital of the world has been both remarkable and amazing. Bollywood movies themselves are a self-contained world with their multiple song and dance routines, intense melodrama, and plots that contain everything from farce to tragedy, but always produce a happy ending. The men and women who created these movies are even more remarkable; and it is this fantastic, rich, diverse story, a veritable Indian fairyland, that Mihir Bose, a native of Bombay, tells with vivid brilliance in the first comprehensive history of this major social and cultural phenomenon.","9789351940456, 9351940454",True,False,605,Performing Arts,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hN6mBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,413,INR,289.1,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hN6mBAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-hN6mBAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2008
vl83ptzvEvoC,history,A History of History,,Alun Munslow,Routledge,"In a provocative analysis of European and American historical thinking and practice since the early 18thcentury,A History of History confronts several basic assumptions about the nature of history. Among these are the concept of historical realism, the belief in representationalism and the idea that the past possesses its own narrative. What is offered in this book is a far-reaching and fundamental rethinking of realist and representationalist ‘history of a particular kind’ by addressing and explaining the ideas of major philosophers of history over the past three hundred years and those of the key theorists of today. In pursuing this radical analysis, the understanding of history as a narrative is evaluated along with contemporary notions such as the continuing presence of the past and the idea of ‘its lessons’. Written by one of the leading thinkers on the subject, A History of Historyprovides an accessible and radical history of history while offering new insights into the pressing questions of the nature, purpose and function of history. This book is an essential text for all students, teachers and consumers of history.","9780415677141, 0415677149",False,True,236,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vl83ptzvEvoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2012

Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, A People's History is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of -- and in the words of -- America's women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers. As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of our country's greatest battles -- the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality -- were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance. Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through President Clinton's first term, A People's History of the United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award in 1981, features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history. Revised, updated, and featuring a new after, word by the author, this special twentieth anniversary edition continues Zinn's important contribution to a complete and balanced understanding of American history.","0060528427, 9780060528423",False,False,764,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9-FtlblxbLgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,12,3.5,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2003

This is a history of the humans in these struggles--the hominid and the hunter, the emperor and the slave, the dictator and the revolutionary.

Rejecting the top-down approach of conventional history, Faulkner contends that it is the mass action of ordinary people that drives the transformative events of our many histories. This is a history of power, abuse, and greed, but also one of liberation, progress, and solidarity. In our fraught political present--as we face the loss of civil liberties and environmental protections, the rise of ethnonationalism, and the looming threat of nuclear war--we need the perspective of these histories now more than ever.

wKXaDwAAQBAJ,history,Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg,A New History of the International Military Tribunal After World War II,Francine Hirsch,,"The Nuremberg Trials (IMT), most notable for their aim to bring perpetrators of Nazi war crimes to justice in the wake of World War II, paved the way for global conversations about genocide, justice, and human rights that continue to this day. As Francine Hirsch reveals in this new history of the trials, a central part of the story has been ignored or forgotten: the critical role the Soviet Union played in making them happen in the first place. While there were practical reasons for this omission--until recently, critical Soviet documents about Nuremberg were buried in the former Soviet archives, and even Russian researchers had limited access--Hirsch shows that there were political reasons as well. The Soviet Union was regarded by its wartime Allies not just as a fellow victor but a rival, and it was not in the interests of the Western powers to highlight the Soviet contribution to postwar justice. Stalin's Show Trials of the 1930s had both provided a model for Nuremberg and made a mockery of it, undermining any pretense of fairness and justice. Further complicating matters was the fact that the Soviets had allied with the Nazis before being invaded by them. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 hung over the courtroom, as did the fact that the everyone knew that the Soviet prosecution had presented the court with falsified evidence about the Katyn massacre of Polish officers, attempting to pin one of their own major war crimes on the Nazis. For lead American prosecutor Robert Jackson and his colleagues, focusing too much on the Soviet role in the trials threatened the overall credibility of the IMT and possibly even the collective memory of the war. Soviet Justice at Nuremberg illuminates the ironies of Stalin's henchmen presiding in moral judgment over the Nazis. In effect, the Nazis had learned mass-suppression and mass-murder techniques from the Soviets, their former allies, and now the latter were judging them for crimes they had themselves committed. Yet the Soviets had borne the brunt of the fighting--and the losses--in World War II, and this gave them undeniable authority. Moreover, Soviet jurists were the first to conceive of a legal framework for viewing war as a crime, and without that framework the IMT would have had no basis. In short, there would be no denying their place at the tribunal, nor their determination to make the most of it. Illuminating the shifting relationships between the four countries involved (the U.S., Great Britain, France, and the U.S.S.R.) Hirsch's book shows how each was not just facing off against the Nazi defendants, but against each other and offers a new history of Nuremberg.","9780199377930, 0199377936",False,True,561,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wKXaDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2020

PIZuDwAAQBAJ,history,Why Learn History (When It’s Already on Your Phone),,Sam Wineburg,University of Chicago Press,"A look at how to teach history in the age of easily accessible—but not always reliable—information. Let’s start with two truths about our era that are so inescapable as to have become clichés: We are surrounded by more readily available information than ever before. And a huge percent of it is inaccurate. Some of the bad info is well-meaning but ignorant. Some of it is deliberately deceptive. All of it is pernicious. With the Internet at our fingertips, what’s a teacher of history to do? In Why Learn History (When It’s Already on Your Phone), professor Sam Wineburg has the answers, beginning with this: We can’t stick to the same old read-the-chapter-answer-the-question snoozefest. If we want to educate citizens who can separate fact from fake, we have to equip them with new tools. Historical thinking, Wineburg shows, has nothing to do with the ability to memorize facts. Instead, it’s an orientation to the world that cultivates reasoned skepticism and counters our tendency to confirm our biases. Wineburg lays out a mine-filled landscape, but one that with care, attention, and awareness, we can learn to navigate. The future of the past may rest on our screens. But its fate rests in our hands.

2Uw4DwAAQBAJ,history,History Comes Alive,Public History and Popular Culture in the 1970s,M. J. Rymsza-Pawlowska,UNC Press Books,"During the 1976 Bicentennial celebration, millions of Americans engaged with the past in brand-new ways. They became absorbed by historical miniseries like Roots, visited museums with new exhibits that immersed them in the past, propelled works of historical fiction onto the bestseller list, and participated in living history events across the nation. While many of these activities were sparked by the Bicentennial, M. J. Rymsza-Pawlowska shows that, in fact, they were symptomatic of a fundamental shift in Americans' relationship to history during the 1960s and 1970s. For the majority of the twentieth century, Americans thought of the past as foundational to, but separate from, the present, and they learned and thought about history in informational terms. But Rymsza-Pawlowska argues that the popular culture of the 1970s reflected an emerging desire to engage and enact the past on a more emotional level: to consider the feelings and motivations of historic individuals and, most importantly, to use this in reevaluating both the past and the present. This thought-provoking book charts the era's shifting feeling for history, and explores how it serves as a foundation for the experience and practice of history making today.","9781469633879, 1469633876",True,True,259,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2Uw4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2017
jKLEDwAAQBAJ,history,Death at the Edges of Empire,"Fallen Soldiers, Cultural Memory, and the Making of an American Nation, 1863-1921",Shannon Bontrager,U of Nebraska Press,"A 2020 BookAuthority selection for best new American Civil War books Hundreds of thousands of individuals perished in the epic conflict of the American Civil War. As battles raged and the specter of death and dying hung over the divided nation, the living worked not only to bury their dead but also to commemorate them. President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address perhaps best voiced the public yearning to memorialize the war dead. His address marked the beginning of a new tradition of commemorating American soldiers and also signaled a transformation in the relationship between the government and the citizenry through an embedded promise and obligation for the living to remember the dead. In Death at the Edges of Empire Shannon Bontrager examines the culture of death, burial, and commemoration of American war dead. By focusing on the Civil War, the Spanish-Cuban-American War, the Philippine-American War, and World War I, Bontrager produces a history of collective memories of war expressed through American cultural traditions emerging within broader transatlantic and transpacific networks. Examining the pragmatic collaborations between middle-class Americans and government officials negotiating the contradictory terrain of empire and nation, Death at the Edges of Empire shows how Americans imposed modern order on the inevitability of death as well as how they used the war dead to reimagine political identities and opportunities into imperial ambitions.","9781496219077, 1496219074",True,True,343,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jKLEDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,6068.27,INR,6068.27,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jKLEDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jKLEDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020

BfCBDwAAQBAJ,history,Physics of Biological Membranes,,"Patricia Bassereau, Pierre Sens",Springer,"This book mainly focuses on key aspects of biomembranes that have emerged over the past 15 years. It covers static and dynamic descriptions, as well as modeling for membrane organization and shape at the local and global (at the cell level) scale. It also discusses several new developments in non-equilibrium aspects that have not yet been covered elsewhere. Biological membranes are the seat of interactions between cells and the rest of the world, and internally, they are at the core of complex dynamic reorganizations and chemical reactions. Despite the long tradition of membrane research in biophysics, the physics of cell membranes as well as of biomimetic or synthetic membranes is a rapidly developing field. Though successful books have already been published on this topic over the past decades, none include the most recent advances. Additionally, in this domain, the traditional distinction between biological and physical approaches tends to blur. This book gathers the most recent advances in this area, and will benefit biologists and physicists alike.","9783030006303, 3030006301",True,True,616,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BfCBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,21004,INR,21004,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfCBDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BfCBDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2018

We begin with the footsteps of a family walking along a beach 950,000 years ago. From here, Montefiore takes us on an exhilarating epic journey through the families that have shaped our world: the Caesars, Medicis and Incas, Ottomans and Mughals, Bonapartes, Habsburgs and Zulus, Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Krupps, Churchills, Kennedys, Castros, Nehrus, Pahlavis and Kenyattas, Saudis, Kims and Assads. A rich cast of complex characters form the beating heart of the story. Some are well-known leaders, from Alexander the Great, Attila, Ivan the Terrible and Genghis Khan to Hitler, Thatcher, Obama, Putin and Zelensky. Some are creative, from Socrates, Michelangelo and Shakespeare to Newton, Mozart, Balzac, Freud, Bowie and Tim Berners-Lee. Others are lesser-known: Hongwu, who began life as a beggar and founded the Ming dynasty; Kamehameha, conqueror of Hawaii; Zenobia, Arab empress who defied Rome; King Henry of Haiti; Lady Murasaki, first female novelist; Sayyida al-Hurra, Moroccan pirate-queen. Here are not just conquerors and queens but prophets, charlatans, actors, gangsters, artists, scientists, doctors, tycoons, lovers, wives, husbands and children. This is world history on the most grand and intimate scale - spanning centuries, continents and cultures, and linking grand themes of war, migration, plague, religion, medicine and technology to the people at the centre of the human drama. As spellbinding as fiction, The World captures the story of humankind in all its joy, sorrow, romance, ingenuity and cruelty in a ground-breaking, single narrative that will forever shift the boundaries of what history can achieve.","9780297869696, 0297869698",True,False,1526,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BoNqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,920.4,INR,460.2,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BoNqEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BoNqEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022

A story of Black queer history, love, loss, and learning to stay in the moment before it passes you by. Weeks ago, Andre Cobb received a much-needed liver transplant. He's ready for his life to finally begin, until one night, when he passes out and wakes up somewhere totally unexpected...in 1969, where he connects with a magnetic boy named Michael. And then, just as suddenly as he arrived, he slips back to present-day Boston, where the family of his donor is waiting to explain that his new liver came with a side effect—the ability to time travel. And they've tasked their youngest son, Blake, with teaching Andre how to use his unexpected new gift. Andre splits his time bouncing between the past and future. Between Michael and Blake. Michael is everything Andre wishes he could be, and Blake, still reeling from the death of his brother, Andre's donor, keeps him at arm's length despite their obvious attraction to each other. Torn between two boys, one in the past and one in the present, Andre has to figure out where he belongs—and more importantly who he wants to be—before the consequences of jumping in time catch up to him and change his future for good.

Taking full advantage of the dramatic details of the protests and conflicts that helped shape the nation, politically, socially, and economically, Ramachandra Guha writes of the factors and processes that have kept the country together, and kept it democratic, defying the numerous prophets of doom. Moving between history and biography, this story provides fresh insights into the lives and public careers of those legendary and long-serving Prime Ministers, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Guha includes vivid sketches of the major “provincial” leaders, but also writes with feeling and sensitivity about lesser-known Indians—peasants, tribals, women, workers, and Untouchables. Massively researched and elegantly written, this is the work of a major scholar at the height of his powers, a brilliant and definitive history of what is possibly the most important, occasionally the most exasperating, and certainly the most interesting country in the world.

ghalDwAAQBAJ,history,The Black Cabinet,The Untold Story of African Americans and Politics During the Age of Roosevelt,Jill Watts,Atlantic Monthly Press,"An in-depth history exploring the evolution, impact, and ultimate demise of what was known in the 1930s and ‘40s as FDR’s Black Cabinet. In 1932 in the midst of the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the presidency with the help of key African American defectors from the Republican Party. At the time, most African Americans lived in poverty, denied citizenship rights and terrorized by white violence. As the New Deal began, a “black Brain Trust” joined the administration and began documenting and addressing the economic hardship and systemic inequalities African Americans faced. They became known as the Black Cabinet, but the environment they faced was reluctant, often hostile, to change. “Will the New Deal be a square deal for the Negro?” The black press wondered. The Black Cabinet set out to devise solutions to the widespread exclusion of black people from its programs, whether by inventing tools to measure discrimination or by calling attention to the administration’s failures. Led by Mary McLeod Bethune, an educator and friend of Eleanor Roosevelt, they were instrumental to Roosevelt’s continued success with black voters. Operating mostly behind the scenes, they helped push Roosevelt to sign an executive order that outlawed discrimination in the defense industry. They saw victories?jobs and collective agriculture programs that lifted many from poverty?and defeats?the bulldozing of black neighborhoods to build public housing reserved only for whites; Roosevelt’s refusal to get behind federal anti-lynching legislation. The Black Cabinet never won official recognition from the president, and with his death, it disappeared from view. But it had changed history. Eventually, one of its members would go on to be the first African American Cabinet secretary; another, the first African American federal judge and mentor to Thurgood Marshall. Masterfully researched and dramatically told, The Black Cabinet brings to life a forgotten generation of leaders who fought post-Reconstruction racial apartheid and whose work served as a bridge that Civil Rights activists traveled to achieve the victories of the 1950s and ’60s.

ol6OzgEACAAJ,history,Recording History,"Jews, Muslims, and Music Across Twentieth-Century North Africa",Christopher Silver,,"A new history of twentieth-century North Africa, that gives voice to the musicians who defined an era and the vibrant recording industry that carried their popular sounds from the colonial period through decolonization. If twentieth-century stories of Jews and Muslims in North Africa are usually told separately, Recording History demonstrates that we have not been listening to what brought these communities together: Arab music. For decades, thousands of phonograph records flowed across North African borders. The sounds embedded in their grooves were shaped in large part by Jewish musicians, who gave voice to a changing world around them. Their popular songs broadcast on radio, performed in concert, and circulated on disc carried with them the power to delight audiences, stir national sentiments, and frustrate French colonial authorities. With this book, Christopher Silver provides the first history of the music scene and recording industry across Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, and offers striking insights into Jewish-Muslim relations through the rhythms that animated them. He traces the path of hit-makers and their hit records, illuminating regional and transnational connections. In asking what North Africa once sounded like, Silver recovers a world of many voices--of pioneering impresarios, daring female stars, cantors turned composers, witnesses and survivors of war, and national and nationalist icons--whose music still resonates well into our present.","1503630560, 9781503630567",False,False,304,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ol6OzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2022

The book addresses theoretical reflections on the public, or multiple publics, and their role in public history, and empirical analyses of the publics’ active responses to and impact on existing forms of public history. Special attention is also paid to digital public history, which facilitates the double role of the public—as both recipient and creator of public history. With a multinational author team, the book is based on various national, but also international, experiences and academic traditions; each chapter goes beyond national cases to look transnationally. The narratives built around their cases deal with issues such as arranging a museum exhibition, managing a history-related website, analyzing readers’ comments or involving non-professional public as oral history researchers.

FHJdEAAAQBAJ,history,Bose,The Untold Story Of An Inconvenient Nationalist,Chandrachur Ghose,Penguin Random House India Private Limited,"'A comprehensive and gripping narrative'---Vikram Sampath, author, historian and Fellow of Royal Historical Society 'A must-read'---Sandeep Unnithan, managing editor, India Today There are not many Indian heroes whose lives have been as dramatic and adventurous as that of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. That, however, is an assessment of his life based on what is widely known about him. These often revolve around his resignation from the Indian Civil Service, joining the freedom movement, to be exiled twice for over seven years, throwing a challenge to the Gandhian leadership in the Congress, taking up an extremist position against the British Raj, evading the famed intelligence network to travel to Europe and then to Southeast Asia, forming two Governments and raising two armies and then disappearing into the unknown. All this in a span of just two decades. Now, new information throws light on Bose's intense political activities surrounding the revolutionary groups in Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra and United Provinces, his efforts to bridge the increasing communal divide and his influence among the splintered political landscape; his outlook and relations with women; his plunge into the depths of spirituality; his penchant for covert operations and his efforts to engineer a rebellion among the Indian armed forces. With this new information, what appeared to be dramatic now becomes more intense with plots and subplots under one man's single-minded focus on freeing the motherland and envisioning its development in a new era. Furthermore, one of the most sensitive issues that have prevented political parties and successive governments from talking much about Bose is his joining the Axis camp. While Jawaharlal Nehru and other prominent Congress leaders publicly denounced the move, the Communist Party of India went on to a prolonged vilification campaign. Sardar Patel issued instruction to Congress leaders to defend the INA soldiers without eulogizing their leader. Was Bose really a Nazi sympathiser? Knowing very well about the strong public opinion that existed among the political leadership and the intelligentsia in India against Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and imperial Japan, why did he risk his own political image by allying with the Axis powers? Pacey, thought-provoking and absolutely unputdownable, Bose: The Untold Story of an Inconvenient Nationalist will open a window to many hitherto untold and unknown stories of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Probably the first critical biography of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose till date.","9789354924569, 9354924565",True,True,830,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FHJdEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1,5,IN,FOR_SALE,True,718.62,INR,359.31,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FHJdEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-FHJdEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022

The new edition also includes a bibliographic essay by Thelin covering significant works in the field that have appeared since the publication of the first edition. At a time when our educational system as a whole is under intense scrutiny, Rudolph's seminal work offers an important historical perspective on the development of higher education in the United States.","9780820312842, 0820312843",False,True,592,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GJvHAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1990
lqxsDwAAQBAJ,history,Bitten,The Secret History of Lyme Disease and Biological Weapons,Kris Newby,HarperCollins,"A riveting thriller reminiscent of The Hot Zone, this true story dives into the mystery surrounding one of the most controversial and misdiagnosed conditions of our time—Lyme disease—and of Willy Burgdorfer, the man who discovered the microbe behind it, revealing his secret role in developing bug-borne biological weapons, and raising terrifying questions about the genesis of the epidemic of tick-borne diseases affecting millions of Americans today. While on vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, Kris Newby was bitten by an unseen tick. That one bite changed her life forever, pulling her into the abyss of a devastating illness that took ten doctors to diagnose and years to recover: Newby had become one of the 300,000 Americans who are afflicted with Lyme disease each year. As a science writer, she was driven to understand why this disease is so misunderstood, and its patients so mistreated. This quest led her to Willy Burgdorfer, the Lyme microbe’s discoverer, who revealed that he had developed bug-borne bioweapons during the Cold War, and believed that the Lyme epidemic was started by a military experiment gone wrong. In a superb, meticulous work of narrative journalism, Bitten takes readers on a journey to investigate these claims, from biological weapons facilities to interviews with biosecurity experts and microbiologists doing cutting-edge research, all the while uncovering darker truths about Willy. It also leads her to uncomfortable questions about why Lyme can be so difficult to both diagnose and treat, and why the government is so reluctant to classify chronic Lyme as a disease. A gripping, infectious page-turner, Bitten will shed a terrifying new light on an epidemic that is exacting an incalculable toll on us, upending much of what we believe we know about it.","9780062896292, 0062896296",True,False,296,Health & Fitness,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lqxsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1058.52,INR,529.26,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lqxsDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-lqxsDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019

From the beginning of human history, the one thing that has defined us is our talent for making things, from basic technology and everyday objects, such as bowls and hand axes, to high-tech inventions, such as supersonic aircraft, smart devices, and Mars rovers. Objects speak volumes about a civilization, telling us how our ancestors lived - as well as what they believed in and valued. A bronze cat mummy shows us how highly the ancient Egyptians valued their feline companions, while a mechanical tiger toy tells the story of rising tensions between an Indian sultan and European colonizers. With stunning, exclusive photography, History of the World in 1000 Objects shows you the objects that our ancestors treasured - from the jewelry worn by the Mesopotamians to the prized ritual vessels used by the people of the Shang Dynasty - and gives you insight into what gave each culture its own identity.

ol6OzgEACAAJ,history,Recording History,"Jews, Muslims, and Music Across Twentieth-Century North Africa",Christopher Silver,,"A new history of twentieth-century North Africa, that gives voice to the musicians who defined an era and the vibrant recording industry that carried their popular sounds from the colonial period through decolonization. If twentieth-century stories of Jews and Muslims in North Africa are usually told separately, Recording History demonstrates that we have not been listening to what brought these communities together: Arab music. For decades, thousands of phonograph records flowed across North African borders. The sounds embedded in their grooves were shaped in large part by Jewish musicians, who gave voice to a changing world around them. Their popular songs broadcast on radio, performed in concert, and circulated on disc carried with them the power to delight audiences, stir national sentiments, and frustrate French colonial authorities. With this book, Christopher Silver provides the first history of the music scene and recording industry across Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, and offers striking insights into Jewish-Muslim relations through the rhythms that animated them. He traces the path of hit-makers and their hit records, illuminating regional and transnational connections. In asking what North Africa once sounded like, Silver recovers a world of many voices--of pioneering impresarios, daring female stars, cantors turned composers, witnesses and survivors of war, and national and nationalist icons--whose music still resonates well into our present.","1503630560, 9781503630567",False,False,304,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ol6OzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2022

Q6OUEAAAQBAJ,history,Art and the Historical Film,Between Realism and the Sublime,Gillian McIver,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,"Art and the Historical Film provides an important examination of fine art's impact on filmmaking, grappling with the question of authenticity. From Eugene Delacroix's interpretation of the 1830 French revolution to Uli Edel's version of the Baader-Meinhof Gang, artistic representations of historical subjects are appealing and pervasive. Movies often adapt imagery from art history, including paintings of historical events. Films and art shape the past for us and continue to affect our interpretation of history. While historical films are often argued over for their adherence to ""the facts,"" their real problem is realism: how can the past be convincingly depicted? Realism in the historical film genre is often nourished and given credibility by its use of painterly references. This book examines how art-historical images affect historical films by going beyond period detail and surface design to look at how profound ideas about history are communicated through pictures. Art and the Historical Film: Between Realism and the Sublime is based on case studies that explore the links between art and cinema, including American independent Western Meek's Cutoff (Kelly Reichardt, 2010), British heritage film Belle (Amma Asante, 2013), and Dutch national epic Admiral (Roel Reiné, 2014). The chapters create immersive worlds that communicate distinct ideas about the past through cinematography, production design, and direction, as the films adapt, reference, and transpose paintings by artists such as Rubens, Albert Bierstadt, and Jacques-Louis David.","9781501384752, 1501384759",True,True,281,Performing Arts,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q6OUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2974,INR,2974,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q6OUEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Q6OUEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022

For over two thousand years it was a crossroads on the major trading route between China and India, but it was not brought together into a single entity until the Dutch extended their rule throughout the Netherlands East Indies in the early part of the 20th century. Declaring its independence from the Dutch in 1945, the Republic of Indonesia was ruled by only two regimes over the next half century Throughout the years the country has continued to be dogged by an inefficient bureaucracy and by perpetual problems of corruption. However, since 2004 Indonesia has successfully carried out four direct elections for president, together with an equal number of elections for legislative bodies at all levels of government, and has finally in 2014 elected a president with no ties to either the military or to the previous authoritarian power structure.

Many of the pages of this book are dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi’s non-cooperation and the civil disobedience movements. It contains detailed description of Subash Chandra Bose’s weapon heavy tactics and his charisma. This book includes all the independence movements and fights, irrespective of their size and impact, covering India in its entirety.

Imagine sitting in a room listening to Hawking discuss these achievements and place them in historical context. It would be like hearing Christopher Columbus on the New World. Hawking presents a series of seven lec-tures—covering everything from big bang to black holes to string theory—that capture not only the brilliance of Hawking’s mind but his characteristic wit as well. Of his research on black holes, which absorbed him for more than a decade, he says, “It might seem a bit like looking for a black cat in a coal cellar.” Hawking begins with a history of ideas about the universe, from Aristotle’s determination that the Earth is round to Hubble’s discovery, over 2000 years later, that the universe is expanding. Using that as a launching pad, he explores the reaches of modern physics, including theories on the origin of the universe (e.g., the big bang), the nature of black holes, and space-time.","9788179925911, 8179925919",True,True,100,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JbRyIIeGLcIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,5,1.5,IN,FOR_SALE,True,234.82,INR,164.37,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JbRyIIeGLcIC&rdid=book-JbRyIIeGLcIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2006

_-B1EAAAQBAJ,history,History by HBO,Televising the American Past,Rebecca Weeks,University Press of Kentucky,"The television industry is changing, and with it, the small screen's potential to engage in debate and present valuable representations of American history. Founded in 1972, HBO has been at the forefront of these changes, leading the way for many network, cable, and streaming services into the ""post-network"" era. Despite this, most scholarship has been dedicated to analyzing historical feature films and documentary films, leaving TV and the long-form drama hungry for coverage. In History by HBO: Televising the American Past, Rebecca Weeks fills the gap in this area of media studies and defends the historiographic power of long-form dramas. By focusing on this change and its effects, History by HBO outlines how history is crafted on television and the diverse forms it can take. Weeks examines the capabilities of the long-form serial for engaging with historical stories, insisting that the shift away from the network model and toward narrowcasting has enabled challenging histories to thrive in home settings. As an examination of HBO's unique structure for producing quality historical dramas, Weeks provides four case studies of HBO series set during different periods of United States history: Band of Brothers (2001), Deadwood (2004–2007), Boardwalk Empire (2012–2014), and Treme (2010–2013). In each case, HBO's lack of advertiser influence, commitment to creative freedom, and generous budgets continue to draw and retain talent who want to tell historical stories. Balancing historical and film theories in her assessment of the roles of mise-en–scène, characterization, narrative complexity, and sound in the production of effective historical dramas, Weeks' evaluation acts as an ode to the most recent Golden Age of TV, as well as a critical look at the relationship between entertainment media and collective memory.","9780813195315, 0813195314",True,True,300,Performing Arts,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_-B1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3539.82,INR,3539.82,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_-B1EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_-B1EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022

MHvDEAAAQBAJ,history,Herbert E. Bolton and the Historiography of the Americas,,Russell Magnaghi,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,"The comparative approach to the understanding of history is increasingly popular today. This study details the evolution of comparative history by examining the career of a pioneer in this area, Herbert E. Bolton, who popularized the notion that hemispheric history should be considered from pole to pole. Bolton traced the study of the history of the Americas back to 16th century European accounts of efforts to bring civilization to the New World, and he argued that only within this larger context could the histories of individual nations be understood. After American entry into the Spanish-American War in 1898, historians such as Bolton promoted the idea of comparative history, and it remains to this day a significant historiographical approach. Consideration of the history of the Americas as a whole dates back to 16th century European treatises on the New World. Chapter one of this study provides an overview of pre-Bolton formulations of such history. In chapter two one sees the forces that shaped Bolton's thinking and brought about the development of the concept. Chapters three and four focus upon the evolution of the approach through Bolton's history course at the University of California at Berkeley and the reception of the concept among Bolton's contemporaries. Unfortunately, Bolton never fully developed the theoretical side of his arguement; thus, chapter five chronicles the decline of his ideas after his death. The final chapter reveals the survival of the concept, which is now embraced by a new generation of historians who are largely unfamiliar with Bolton's instrumental role in the promotion of comparative history.","9780313031762, 0313031762",False,True,238,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MHvDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,7105,INR,7105,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MHvDEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-MHvDEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,1998

9QVDDQAAQBAJ,history,A Law of Peoples for Recognizing States,"On Rawls, the Social Contract, and Membership in the International Community",Chris Naticchia,Lexington Books,"Which political entities should the international community recognize as member states—granting them the rights and powers of statehood and entitling them to participate in formulating, adjudicating, and implementing international law? What criteria should it use, and are those criteria defensible? From Kosovo, Palestine, and Taiwan to South Sudan, Scotland, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Catalonia, these questions continuously arise and constantly challenge the international community for a consistent, principled stance. In response to this challenge, Chris Naticchia offers a social contract argument for a theory of international recognition—a normative theory of the criteria that states and international bodies should use to recognize political entities as member states of the international community. Regardless of whether political entities adequately respect human rights or practice democracy, he argues, we must recognize a critical mass of them to get international institutions working. Then we should recognize secessionist entities that suffer from persistent, grave, and widespread human rights abuses by their government—and, under certain conditions, minority nations within multinational states that seek independence. We must also recognize entities whose recognition would contribute to the economic development of the least well-off entities. Drawing on the social contract tradition, and developing a broadly Rawlsian view, A Law of Peoples for Recognizing States will both challenge and appeal to a broad readership in political philosophy, international law, and international relations.","9781498526142, 1498526144",True,True,295,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9QVDDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,11782.55,INR,11782.55,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9QVDDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-9QVDDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2016

YsWAEAAAQBAJ,history,Our Reason for Being,An Exposition of Ecclesiastes on the Meaning of Life,T. F. Leong,Wipf and Stock Publishers,Ecclesiastes is a persuasive speech with a rhetoric so unique that it can be easily misunderstood. It speaks powerfully to believers as well as nonbelievers because it addresses the question of the meaning of life in the most satisfying way. The heart of this book is an expositional commentary that interprets Ecclesiastes as authoritative Scripture. It seeks to recover the rhetoric of the speech in terms of its comprehensive message on the meaning of life as well as its compelling force to get the message across. Preceding the expositional commentary is an introduction to Ecclesiastes that presents a new approach to outlining and reading Ecclesiastes as a coherent speech. It also presents an overview of the “forest”—the overall rhetorical flow of the speech from beginning to end. This is to prevent one from getting lost when immersed in the “trees” of the expositional commentary. Following the expositional commentary are two topical studies to give Ecclesiastes the breadth and depth of coverage it deserves. The first is an interdisciplinary exposition on the meaning of life. The second is an interpretive essay to defend exegetically the interpretation of Ecclesiastes as a coherent speech.,"9781666717068, 1666717061",False,True,267,Religion,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YsWAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3236.41,INR,3236.41,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YsWAEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-YsWAEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022

FWaXEAAAQBAJ,history,Critical Legal Education as a Subversive Activity,,"Helen Gibbon, Ben Golder, Lucas Lixinski, Marina Nehme, Prue Vines",Taylor & Francis,"In an age when everyone aspires to teach critical thinking skills in the classroom, what does it mean to be a subversive law teacher? Who or what might a subversive law teacher seek to subvert – the authority of the law, the university, their own authority as teachers, perhaps? Are law students ripe for subversion, agents of, or impediments to, subversion? Do they learn to ask critical questions? Responding to the provocation in the classic book Teaching as a Subversive Activity, by Postman and Weingartner, the idea that teaching could, or even should, be subversive still holds true today, and its premise is particularly relevant in the context of legal education. We therefore draw on this classic book to discuss, in the present volume, the consideration of research into legal education as lifetime learning, as creating meaning, as transformative and as developing world-changing thinking within the legal context. The volume offers research into classroom experiences and theoretical and historical interrogations of what it means to teach law subversively. Primarily aimed at legal educators and doctoral students in law planning careers as academics, its insights speak directly to tensions in higher education more broadly.","9781000806694, 1000806693",True,True,250,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FWaXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3138.8,INR,3138.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FWaXEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-FWaXEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2015

SeuiDwAAQBAJ,history,Who Owns History?,Elgin's Loot and the Case for Returning Plundered Treasure,Geoffrey Robertson,Biteback Publishing,"The biggest question in the world of art and culture concerns the return of property taken without consent. Throughout history, conquerors or colonial masters have taken artefacts from subjugated peoples, who now want them returned from museums and private collections in Europe and the USA. The controversy rages on over the Elgin Marbles, and has been given immediacy by figures such as France's President Macron, who says he will order French museums to return hundreds of artworks acquired by force or fraud in Africa, and by British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has pledged that a Labour government would return the Elgin Marbles to Greece. Elsewhere, there is a debate in Belgium about whether the Africa Museum, newly opened with 120,000 items acquired mainly by armed forces in the Congo, should close. Although there is an international convention dated 1970 that deals with the restoration of artefacts stolen since that time, there is no agreement on the rules of law or ethics which should govern the fate of objects forcefully or lawlessly acquired in previous centuries. Who Owns History? delves into the crucial debate over the Elgin Marbles, but also offers a system for the return of cultural property based on human rights law principles that are being developed by the courts. It is not a legal text, but rather an examination of how the past can be experienced by everyone, as well as by the people of the country of origin.","9781785905421, 1785905422",True,True,321,Art,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SeuiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1416,INR,708,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SeuiDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-SeuiDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019

Tagore’s idea of nationalism is deep-rooted in his belief that growth has to be all-inclusive – not just for a nation, but also for its people. This book is a collection of Tagore’s lectures on Nationalism in the West, Japan and India. His mastery with expression is further highlighted as he recounts the need of the concept of Nation to benefit its people, and not just exist as an idealistic theory that benefits a few. Nationalism brings to fore Tagore’s deep understanding of contemporary politics and paves a middle path between growth of the people and a nation, and aggressive ways towards modernity.","9789390441150, 9390441153",True,True,80,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uGcWEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,94.4,INR,94.4,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uGcWEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-uGcWEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021
VdX18Ag6V7EC,history,A Disability History of the United States,,Kim E. Nielsen,Beacon Press,"The first book to cover the entirety of disability history, from pre-1492 to the present Disability is not just the story of someone we love or the story of whom we may become; rather it is undoubtedly the story of our nation. Covering the entirety of US history from pre-1492 to the present, A Disability History of the United States is the first book to place the experiences of people with disabilities at the center of the American narrative. In many ways, it’s a familiar telling. In other ways, however, it is a radical repositioning of US history. By doing so, the book casts new light on familiar stories, such as slavery and immigration, while breaking ground about the ties between nativism and oralism in the late nineteenth century and the role of ableism in the development of democracy. A Disability History of the United States pulls from primary-source documents and social histories to retell American history through the eyes, words, and impressions of the people who lived it. As historian and disability scholar Nielsen argues, to understand disability history isn’t to narrowly focus on a series of individual triumphs but rather to examine mass movements and pivotal daily events through the lens of varied experiences. Throughout the book, Nielsen deftly illustrates how concepts of disability have deeply shaped the American experience—from deciding who was allowed to immigrate to establishing labor laws and justifying slavery and gender discrimination. Included are absorbing—at times horrific—narratives of blinded slaves being thrown overboard and women being involuntarily sterilized, as well as triumphant accounts of disabled miners organizing strikes and disability rights activists picketing Washington. Engrossing and profound, A Disability History of the United States fundamentally reinterprets how we view our nation’s past: from a stifling master narrative to a shared history that encompasses us all.","9780807022030, 0807022039",True,False,290,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VdX18Ag6V7EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1085.6,INR,542.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VdX18Ag6V7EC&rdid=book-VdX18Ag6V7EC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2012
kBAtEAAAQBAJ,history,Slave Revolt on Screen,The Haitian Revolution in Film and Video Games,Alyssa Goldstein Sepinwall,Univ. Press of Mississippi,"Recipient of the 2021 Honorary Mention for the Haiti Book Prize from the Haitian Studies Association In Slave Revolt on Screen: The Haitian Revolution in Film and Video Games author Alyssa Goldstein Sepinwall analyzes how films and video games from around the world have depicted slave revolt, focusing on the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804). This event, the first successful revolution by enslaved people in modern history, sent shock waves throughout the Atlantic World. Regardless of its historical significance however, this revolution has become less well-known—and appears less often on screen—than most other revolutions; its story, involving enslaved Africans liberating themselves through violence, does not match the suffering-slaves-waiting-for-a-white-hero genre that pervades Hollywood treatments of Black history. Despite Hollywood’s near-silence on this event, some films on the Revolution do exist—from directors in Haiti, the US, France, and elsewhere. Slave Revolt on Screen offers the first-ever comprehensive analysis of Haitian Revolution cinema, including completed films and planned projects that were never made. In addition to studying cinema, this book also breaks ground in examining video games, a pop-culture form long neglected by historians. Sepinwall scrutinizes video game depictions of Haitian slave revolt that appear in games like the Assassin’s Creed series that have reached millions more players than comparable films. In analyzing films and games on the revolution, Slave Revolt on Screen calls attention to the ways that economic legacies of slavery and colonialism warp pop-culture portrayals of the past and leave audiences with distorted understandings.","9781496833129, 1496833120",True,True,359,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kBAtEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3034.13,INR,3034.13,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kBAtEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-kBAtEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021

Taking their cues from recent breakthroughs in genetics and the neurosciences, advocates of “big history” are reassessing long-held assumptions about the very definition of history, its methods, and its evidentiary base. In Scientific History, Elena Aronova maps out historians’ continuous engagement with the methods, tools, values, and scale of the natural sciences by examining several waves of their experimentation that surged highest at perceived times of trouble, from the crisis-ridden decades of the early twentieth century to the ruptures of the Cold War. The book explores the intertwined trajectories of six intellectuals and the larger programs they set in motion: Henri Berr (1863–1954), Nikolai Bukharin (1888–1938), Lucien Febvre (1878–1956), Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943), Julian Huxley (1887–1975), and John Desmond Bernal (1901–1971).

jOZSEAAAQBAJ,history,"Trauma, Experience and Narrative in Europe after World War II",,"Ville Kivimäki, Peter Leese",Springer Nature,"This book promotes a historically and culturally sensitive understanding of trauma during and after World War II. Focusing especially on Eastern and Central Europe, its contributors take a fresh look at the experiences of violence and loss in 1939–45 and their long-term effects in different cultures and societies. The chapters analyze traumatic experiences among soldiers and civilians alike and expand the study of traumatic violence beyond psychiatric discourses and treatments. While acknowledging the problems of applying a present-day medical concept to the past, this book makes a case for a cultural, social and historical study of trauma. Moving the focus of historical trauma studies from World War I to World War II and from Western Europe to the east, it breaks new ground and helps to explain the troublesome politics of memory and trauma in post-1945 Europe all the way to the present day.

MQtFDwAAQBAJ,history,An African American and Latinx History of the United States,,Paul Ortiz,Beacon Press,"An intersectional history of the shared struggle for African American and Latinx civil rights Spanning more than two hundred years, An African American and Latinx History of the United States is a revolutionary, politically charged narrative history, arguing that the “Global South” was crucial to the development of America as we know it. Scholar and activist Paul Ortiz challenges the notion of westward progress as exalted by widely taught formulations like “manifest destiny” and “Jacksonian democracy,” and shows how placing African American, Latinx, and Indigenous voices unapologetically front and center transforms US history into one of the working class organizing against imperialism. Drawing on rich narratives and primary source documents, Ortiz links racial segregation in the Southwest and the rise and violent fall of a powerful tradition of Mexican labor organizing in the twentieth century, to May 1, 2006, known as International Workers’ Day, when migrant laborers—Chicana/os, Afrocubanos, and immigrants from every continent on earth—united in resistance on the first “Day Without Immigrants.” As African American civil rights activists fought Jim Crow laws and Mexican labor organizers warred against the suffocating grip of capitalism, Black and Spanish-language newspapers, abolitionists, and Latin American revolutionaries coalesced around movements built between people from the United States and people from Central America and the Caribbean. In stark contrast to the resurgence of “America First” rhetoric, Black and Latinx intellectuals and organizers today have historically urged the United States to build bridges of solidarity with the nations of the Americas. Incisive and timely, this bottom-up history, told from the interconnected vantage points of Latinx and African Americans, reveals the radically different ways that people of the diaspora have addressed issues still plaguing the United States today, and it offers a way forward in the continued struggle for universal civil rights. 2018 Winner of the PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award","9780807013106, 0807013102",False,False,298,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MQtFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

As interested, if not more so, in the characters from his books—finished or unfinished—as with the members of his family or his daily life, the narrator lays bare the act of writing and imagining, finally giving us a glimpse of the mythical place where the characters of fiction dwell before they come into existence in books.

fISmDwAAQBAJ,history,Black Spartacus,The Epic Life of Toussaint Louverture,Sudhir Hazareesingh,Penguin UK,"The definitive modern biography of the great slave leader, military genius and revolutionary hero Toussaint Louverture The Haitian Revolution began in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue with a slave revolt in August 1791, and culminated a dozen years later in the proclamation of the world's first independent black state. After the abolition of slavery in 1793, Toussaint Louverture, himself a former slave, became the leader of the colony's black population, the commander of its republican army and eventually its governor. During the course of his extraordinary life he confronted some of the dominant forces of his age - slavery, settler colonialism, imperialism and racial hierarchy. Treacherously seized by Napoleon's invading army in 1802, this charismatic figure ended his days, in Wordsworth's phrase, 'the most unhappy man of men', imprisoned in a fortress in France. Black Spartacus draws on a wealth of archival material, much of it overlooked by previous biographers, to follow every step of Louverture's singular journey, from his triumphs against French, Spanish and British troops to his skilful regional diplomacy, his Machiavellian dealings with successive French colonial administrators and his bold promulgation of an autonomous Constitution. Sudhir Hazareesingh shows that Louverture developed his unique vision and leadership not solely in response to imported Enlightenment ideals and revolutionary events in Europe and the Americas, but through a hybrid heritage of fraternal slave organisations, Caribbean mysticism and African political traditions. Above all, Hazareesingh retrieves Louverture's rousing voice and force of personality, making this the most engaging, as well as the most complete, biography to date. After his death in the French fortress, Louverture became a figure of legend, a beacon for slaves across the Atlantic and for generations of European republicans and progressive figures in the Americas. He inspired the anti-slavery campaigner Frederick Douglass, the most eminent nineteenth-century African-American; his emancipatory struggle was hailed by those who defied imperial and colonial rule well into the twentieth.

jIBbDwAAQBAJ,history,A Fistful of Shells,West Africa from the Rise of the Slave Trade to the Age of Revolution,Toby Green,Penguin UK,"Winner of the Nayef Al-Rodhan Prize for Global Cultural Understanding 2019 Shortlisted for the Cundill History Prize and the Pius Adesanmi Memorial Award 'Astonishing, staggering' Ben Okri, Daily Telegraph A groundbreaking new history that will transform our view of West Africa By the time of the 'Scramble for Africa' in the late nineteenth century, Africa had already been globally connected for many centuries. Its gold had fuelled the economies of Europe and Islamic world since around 1000, and its sophisticated kingdoms had traded with Europeans along the coasts from Senegal down to Angola since the fifteenth century. Until at least 1650, this was a trade of equals, using a variety of currencies - most importantly shells: the cowrie shells imported from the Maldives, and the nzimbu shells imported from Brazil. Toby Green's groundbreaking new book transforms our view of West and West-Central Africa. It reconstructs the world of kingdoms whose existence (like those of Europe) revolved around warfare, taxation, trade, diplomacy, complex religious beliefs, royal display and extravagance, and the production of art. Over time, the relationship between Africa and Europe revolved ever more around the trade in slaves, damaging Africa's relative political and economic power as the terms of monetary exchange shifted drastically in Europe's favour. In spite of these growing capital imbalances, longstanding contacts ensured remarkable connections between the Age of Revolution in Europe and America and the birth of a revolutionary nineteenth century in Africa. A Fistful of Shells draws not just on written histories, but on archival research in nine countries, on art, praise-singers, oral history, archaeology, letters, and the author's personal experience to create a new perspective on the history of one of the world's most important regions.","9780241003282, 0241003288",True,False,536,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jIBbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,530.11,INR,265.06,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jIBbDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jIBbDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019

E46nDwAAQBAJ,history,Savarkar,"Echoes from a Forgotten Past, 1883–1924",Vikram Sampath,Penguin Random House India Private Limited,"As the intellectual fountainhead of the ideology of Hindutva, which is in political ascendancy in India today, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar is undoubtedly one of the most contentious political thinkers and leaders of the twentieth century. Accounts of his eventful and stormy life have oscillated from eulogizing hagiographies to disparaging demonization. The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between and has unfortunately never been brought to light. Savarkar and his ideology stood as one of the strongest and most virulent opponents of Gandhi, his pacifist philosophy and the Indian National Congress. An alleged atheist and a staunch rationalist who opposed orthodox Hindu beliefs, encouraged inter-caste marriage and dining, and dismissed cow worship as mere superstition, Savarkar was, arguably, the most vocal political voice for the Hindu community through the entire course of India's freedom struggle. From the heady days of revolution and generating international support for the cause of India's freedom as a law student in London, Savarkar found himself arrested, unfairly tried for sedition, transported and incarcerated at the Cellular Jail, in the Andamans, for over a decade, where he underwent unimaginable torture. From being an optimistic advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity in his treatise on the 1857 War of Independence, what was it that transformed him in the Cellular Jail to a proponent of 'Hindutva', which viewed Muslims with suspicion? Drawing from a vast range of original archival documents across India and abroad, this biography in two parts-the first focusing on the years leading up to his incarceration and eventual release from the Kalapani-puts Savarkar, his life and philosophy in a new perspective and looks at the man with all his achievements and failings.","9789353056148, 9353056144",True,True,757,Literary Collections,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2,5,IN,FOR_SALE,True,897.98,INR,448.99,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E46nDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-E46nDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019

With this seemingly simple question, Nicholas Dames embarks on a literary journey spanning two millennia, revealing how an ancient editorial technique became a universally recognized component of narrative art and a means to register the sensation of time. Dames begins with the textual compilations of the Roman world, where chapters evolved as a tool to organize information. He goes on to discuss the earliest divisional systems of the Gospels and the segmentation of medieval romances, describing how the chapter took on new purpose when applied to narrative texts and how narrative segmentation gave rise to a host of aesthetic techniques. Dames shares engaging and in-depth readings of influential figures, from Sterne, Goethe, Tolstoy, and Dickens to George Eliot, Machado de Assis, B. S. Johnson, Agnès Varda, Uwe Johnson, Jennifer Egan, and László Krasznahorkai. He illuminates the sometimes tacit, sometimes dramatic ways in which the chapter became a kind of reckoning with time and a quiet but persistent feature of modernity. Ranging from ancient tablets and scrolls to contemporary fiction and film, The Chapter provides a compelling, elegantly written history of a familiar compositional mode that readers often take for granted and offers a new theory of how this versatile means of dividing narrative sculpts our experience of time.","9780691271026, 069127102X",False,True,384,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_dQdEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2025

AsZjzgEACAAJ,history,Fractured Freedom,A Prison Memoir,Kobad Ghandy,,"Born in the cradle of upper-middle-class privilege in a Mumbai Parsi household and educated at one of India's finest schools, Kobad Ghandy's life and career could have scaled heights in the bustling world of corporate finance. Only it did not. Instead, he chose to become an activist working for the oppressed of the country. Shocked by the racism he witnessed in the UK as a student and learning of the horrors of colonial rule in India, he determined to serve those struck the harshest by the cruel inequalities of his country. Fractured Freedom takes you through the journey of an honest man and his partner, Anuradha's, to a difficult destiny. Here is the story of two people who dedicated their lives in the service of the marginalized, and who believed that true revolution required direct action for a more human and just society. Part memoir, part prison diary, Ghandy bares it all looking back at their lives, love, loss and politics, so intrinsically tied together. Having languished in Indian prisons for over a decade, he tells of his long incarceration, of his fellow prisoners, and of the Kafkaesque experiences with the Indian legal system. This is the candid and unfiltered account of how an unjust system breaks the brave and bold-hearted. A story of life in extremes - the height of privilege and the depth of despair, a story of our times, of a path many would shy away from.","8194969166, 9788194969167",False,False,316,Communists,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AsZjzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2021

'Ikigai urges individuals to simplify their lives by pursuing what sparks joy for them' (Marie '' Kondo) Every moment in our life happens only once, and if we let it slip away, we lose it forever-an idea captured by the Japanese phrase ichigo ichie. Often used to convey that the encounter is unique and special, it is a tenet of Zen Buddhism and is attributed to a sixteenth-century master of the Japanese tea ceremony, or 'ceremony of attention', whose intricate rituals compel us to focus on the present moment. From this age-old concept comes a new kind of mindfulness. In The Book of Ichigo Ichie, you will learn to use all five senses to anchor yourself in the present.

MQtFDwAAQBAJ,history,An African American and Latinx History of the United States,,Paul Ortiz,Beacon Press,"An intersectional history of the shared struggle for African American and Latinx civil rights Spanning more than two hundred years, An African American and Latinx History of the United States is a revolutionary, politically charged narrative history, arguing that the “Global South” was crucial to the development of America as we know it. Scholar and activist Paul Ortiz challenges the notion of westward progress as exalted by widely taught formulations like “manifest destiny” and “Jacksonian democracy,” and shows how placing African American, Latinx, and Indigenous voices unapologetically front and center transforms US history into one of the working class organizing against imperialism. Drawing on rich narratives and primary source documents, Ortiz links racial segregation in the Southwest and the rise and violent fall of a powerful tradition of Mexican labor organizing in the twentieth century, to May 1, 2006, known as International Workers’ Day, when migrant laborers—Chicana/os, Afrocubanos, and immigrants from every continent on earth—united in resistance on the first “Day Without Immigrants.” As African American civil rights activists fought Jim Crow laws and Mexican labor organizers warred against the suffocating grip of capitalism, Black and Spanish-language newspapers, abolitionists, and Latin American revolutionaries coalesced around movements built between people from the United States and people from Central America and the Caribbean. In stark contrast to the resurgence of “America First” rhetoric, Black and Latinx intellectuals and organizers today have historically urged the United States to build bridges of solidarity with the nations of the Americas. Incisive and timely, this bottom-up history, told from the interconnected vantage points of Latinx and African Americans, reveals the radically different ways that people of the diaspora have addressed issues still plaguing the United States today, and it offers a way forward in the continued struggle for universal civil rights. 2018 Winner of the PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award","9780807013106, 0807013102",False,False,298,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MQtFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

The Tiger's Pause chronicles Gurudev's time in a highly-strung country and also offers an exclusive look into the final chapters of Sri Lanka's deadly conflict. Author Swami Virupaksha, who spent nine years in the country expounding The Art of Living courses and organizing Gurudev's visits, expertly charts the enormous hope of the Tamil and Sinhalese people against overwhelming misery. With prose that is both concise and empathetic, Swami Virupaksha gives readers a sweeping view of Gurudev's endeavours towards a ceasefire agreement, and the ups and downs of a country's quest for peace. The Tiger's Pause is the narrative of the Sri Lankan people, and what it takes to understand and address a shared trauma.","9789391149802, 9391149804",True,True,163,Political Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=snw8EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,358.72,INR,251.1,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=snw8EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-snw8EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022

Although Axelrod investigates some dumb decisions by stupid people and some evil decisions by evil people, the overwhelming majority of these decisions were made by good, smart people whose poor judgment produced disastrous, often irreversible results. The 35 compelling and often poignant stories, which range from ancient times to today, include: The Trojan Horse; the Children s Crusade; the sailing of the ""Titanic,"" and the false belief that it just couldn t sink; Edward Bernays s 1929 campaign to recruit women smokers; Neville Chamberlain s appeasement of the Nazis; Ken Lay s deception with Enron; and even the choice to create a New Coke and fix what wasn t broke. As with ""Profiles in Audacity,"" the deftly drawn vignettes will pique interest, satisfy curiosity, give pleasure, and present valuable lessons. And in addition to offering the same insightful analysis of the decision-making process, ""Folly"" also includes objective post-mortems that explain what went wrong and why.

The Shoah has become synonymous with unspeakable atrocity and unbearable suffering. Yet it has also been used to teach tolerance, empathy, resistance, and hope. Understanding and Teaching the Holocaust provides a starting point for teachers in many disciplines to illuminate this crucial event in world history for students. Using a vast array of source materials—from literature and film to survivor testimonies and interviews—the contributors demonstrate how to guide students through these sensitive and painful subjects within their specific historical and social contexts. Each chapter provides pedagogical case studies for teaching content such as antisemitism, resistance and rescue, and the postwar lives of displaced persons.

Vl1PEAAAQBAJ,history,Indomitable,"A Working Woman's Notes on Work, Life and Leadership",Arundhati Bhattacharya,Harper Collins,"Of Small Towns, Big Dreams and Greater Achievements Growing up in the sleepy towns of Bhilai and Bokaro, Arundhati Bhattacharya never imagined that one day she would go on to chair India's largest bank. It was sheer chance that she came to know of the bank probationary officers' entrance examination through a friend. She applied, was selected and went on to have a glorious banking career spanning four decades. Indomitable is the story of Arundhati's life as a banker and the challenges she faced in a male-dominated bastion. She takes the reader through her childhood and early education in the 1960s, getting to Kolkata for her college education and then into the State Bank of India(SBI), where she started her career. The life of a woman banker with a family in a frequently transferrable job isn't easy. In Arundhati's life, too, there were breaking points when she almost thought of quitting her career to balance her personal aspirations with her family's needs. But she didn't give up. Instead, she faced her challenges with humour and positivity and took up every assignment as a new chapter in learning and adapting. In her role as the chairman of SBI, she steered the bank through some of its worst phases. She inspired confidence in the banking sector when the NPA crises led to a significant public-trust deficit. Under her leadership, SBI metamorphosed into a customer-centric and digitally advanced bank while playing a pivotal role in national development. Some of her human resources initiatives included industry-first practices that were appreciated and later adopted by other banks. Candid, lucid and humble, Indomitable is a story that will galvanize you to embrace challenges, break barriers, push forward and achieve greater heights.","9789354894541, 9354894542",True,False,312,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vl1PEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1,5,IN,FOR_SALE,True,559,INR,279.5,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vl1PEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Vl1PEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022
jOZSEAAAQBAJ,history,"Trauma, Experience and Narrative in Europe after World War II",,"Ville Kivimäki, Peter Leese",Springer Nature,"This book promotes a historically and culturally sensitive understanding of trauma during and after World War II. Focusing especially on Eastern and Central Europe, its contributors take a fresh look at the experiences of violence and loss in 1939–45 and their long-term effects in different cultures and societies. The chapters analyze traumatic experiences among soldiers and civilians alike and expand the study of traumatic violence beyond psychiatric discourses and treatments. While acknowledging the problems of applying a present-day medical concept to the past, this book makes a case for a cultural, social and historical study of trauma. Moving the focus of historical trauma studies from World War I to World War II and from Western Europe to the east, it breaks new ground and helps to explain the troublesome politics of memory and trauma in post-1945 Europe all the way to the present day.

Burning the Books describes the deliberate destruction of the knowledge safeguarded in libraries from Alexandria to Sarajevo, from smashed Assyrian tablets to the torching of the Library of Congress. The director of the world-famous Bodleian Libraries, Richard Ovenden, captures the political, religious, and cultural motivations behind these acts. He also shines a light on the librarians and archivists preserving history and memory, often risking their lives in the process. More than simply repositories for knowledge, libraries support the rule of law and inspire and inform citizens.

Each moment in every performance he examines—whether it’s the twenty-seven seconds in “Gimme Shelter” in which Merry Clayton wails the words “rape, murder,” a schoolyard fistfight, a dance marathon, or the instant in a game of spades right after the cards are dealt—has layers of resonance in Black and white cultures, the politics of American empire, and Abdurraqib’s own personal history of love, grief, and performance. Touching on Michael Jackson, Patti LaBelle, Billy Dee Williams, the Wu-Tan Clan, Dave Chappelle, and more, Abdurraqib writes prose brimming with jubilation and pain. With care and generosity, he explains the poignancy of performances big and small, each one feeling intensely familiar and vital, both timeless and desperately urgent. Filled with sharp insight, humor, and heart, A Little Devil in America exalts the Black performance that unfolds in specific moments in time and space—from midcentury Paris to the moon, and back down again to a cramped living room in Columbus, Ohio.

QhRZDwAAQBAJ,history,The Book,,Amaranth Borsuk,MIT Press,"The book as object, as content, as idea, as interface. What is the book in a digital age? Is it a physical object containing pages encased in covers? Is it a portable device that gives us access to entire libraries? The codex, the book as bound paper sheets, emerged around 150 CE. It was preceded by clay tablets and papyrus scrolls. Are those books? In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Amaranth Borsuk considers the history of the book, the future of the book, and the idea of the book. Tracing the interrelationship of form and content in the book's development, she bridges book history, book arts, and electronic literature to expand our definition of an object we thought we knew intimately. Contrary to the many reports of its death (which has been blamed at various times on newspapers, television, and e-readers), the book is alive. Despite nostalgic paeans to the codex and its printed pages, Borsuk reminds us, the term “book” commonly refers to both medium and content. And the medium has proved to be malleable. Rather than pinning our notion of the book to a single form, Borsuk argues, we should remember its long history of transformation. Considering the book as object, content, idea, and interface, she shows that the physical form of the book has always been the site of experimentation and play. Rather than creating a false dichotomy between print and digital media, we should appreciate their continuities.","9780262535410, 0262535416",False,True,346,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QhRZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018
jIBbDwAAQBAJ,history,A Fistful of Shells,West Africa from the Rise of the Slave Trade to the Age of Revolution,Toby Green,Penguin UK,"Winner of the Nayef Al-Rodhan Prize for Global Cultural Understanding 2019 Shortlisted for the Cundill History Prize and the Pius Adesanmi Memorial Award 'Astonishing, staggering' Ben Okri, Daily Telegraph A groundbreaking new history that will transform our view of West Africa By the time of the 'Scramble for Africa' in the late nineteenth century, Africa had already been globally connected for many centuries. Its gold had fuelled the economies of Europe and Islamic world since around 1000, and its sophisticated kingdoms had traded with Europeans along the coasts from Senegal down to Angola since the fifteenth century. Until at least 1650, this was a trade of equals, using a variety of currencies - most importantly shells: the cowrie shells imported from the Maldives, and the nzimbu shells imported from Brazil. Toby Green's groundbreaking new book transforms our view of West and West-Central Africa. It reconstructs the world of kingdoms whose existence (like those of Europe) revolved around warfare, taxation, trade, diplomacy, complex religious beliefs, royal display and extravagance, and the production of art. Over time, the relationship between Africa and Europe revolved ever more around the trade in slaves, damaging Africa's relative political and economic power as the terms of monetary exchange shifted drastically in Europe's favour. In spite of these growing capital imbalances, longstanding contacts ensured remarkable connections between the Age of Revolution in Europe and America and the birth of a revolutionary nineteenth century in Africa. A Fistful of Shells draws not just on written histories, but on archival research in nine countries, on art, praise-singers, oral history, archaeology, letters, and the author's personal experience to create a new perspective on the history of one of the world's most important regions.","9780241003282, 0241003288",True,False,536,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jIBbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,530.11,INR,265.06,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jIBbDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jIBbDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2019

Under her, the ancient country attained virtually all the attributes of a modern state and it was she who abolished gruesome punishments like ‘death by a thousand cuts’ and put an end to foot-binding. Jung Chang comprehensively overturns the conventional view of Cixi as a diehard conservative and cruel despot and also takes the reader into the depths of her splendid Summer Palace and the harem of Beijing’s Forbidden City, where she lived surrounded by eunuchs – with one of whom she fell in love, with tragic consequences. Packed with drama, fast-paced and gripping, it is both a panoramic depiction of the birth of modern China and an intimate portrait of a woman: as the concubine to a monarch, as the absolute ruler of a third of the world’s population, and as a unique stateswoman. ‘Powerful’ Simon Sebag Montefiore ‘Truly authoritative’ New York Times ‘Wonderful’ Sunday Times **Shortlisted for the James Tait Black Biography Prize**","9781448191420, 1448191424",True,False,460,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUiXAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,441.61,INR,309.13,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hUiXAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-hUiXAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2013

With this seemingly simple question, Nicholas Dames embarks on a literary journey spanning two millennia, revealing how an ancient editorial technique became a universally recognized component of narrative art and a means to register the sensation of time. Dames begins with the textual compilations of the Roman world, where chapters evolved as a tool to organize information. He goes on to discuss the earliest divisional systems of the Gospels and the segmentation of medieval romances, describing how the chapter took on new purpose when applied to narrative texts and how narrative segmentation gave rise to a host of aesthetic techniques. Dames shares engaging and in-depth readings of influential figures, from Sterne, Goethe, Tolstoy, and Dickens to George Eliot, Machado de Assis, B. S. Johnson, Agnès Varda, Uwe Johnson, Jennifer Egan, and László Krasznahorkai. He illuminates the sometimes tacit, sometimes dramatic ways in which the chapter became a kind of reckoning with time and a quiet but persistent feature of modernity. Ranging from ancient tablets and scrolls to contemporary fiction and film, The Chapter provides a compelling, elegantly written history of a familiar compositional mode that readers often take for granted and offers a new theory of how this versatile means of dividing narrative sculpts our experience of time.","9780691271026, 069127102X",False,True,384,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_dQdEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2025

MYLSEAAAQBAJ,history,Panepiphanal World,James Joyce's Epiphanies,Sangam MacDuff,University Press of Florida,"Panepiphanal World is the first in-depth study of the forty short texts James Joyce called “epiphanies.” Composed between 1901 and 1904, at the beginning of Joyce’s writing career, these texts are often dismissed as juvenilia. Sangam MacDuff argues that the epiphanies are an important point of origin for Joyce’s entire body of work, showing how they shaped the structure, style, and language of his later writings. Tracing the ways Joyce incorporates the epiphanies into Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Ulysses, and Finnegans Wake, MacDuff describes the defining characteristics of the epiphanies—silence and repetition, materiality and reflexivity—as a set of recurrent and inter-related tensions in the development of Joyce’s oeuvre. MacDuff uses fresh archival evidence, including a new typescript of the epiphanies that he discovered, to show the importance of the epiphanies throughout Joyce’s career. MacDuff compares Joyce’s concept of epiphany to classical, biblical, and Romantic revelations, showing that instead of pointing to divine transcendence or the awakening of the sublime, Joyce’s epiphanies are rooted in and focused on language. MacDuff argues that the Joycean epiphany is an apt characterization of modernist literature and that the linguistic forces at play in these early texts are also central to the work of Joyce’s contemporaries including Woolf, Beckett, and Eliot.

Due to the advent of alien tribes in India, this period opened new vistas of transitional era and ventilated new air of thoughtful broodings, establishing sound venues in the economic field of India making a peep into India's ties with neighbouring and distant countries in the spheres of trade and commerce, transport and communication. The present work is not merely a survey but a microscopic and complete reexamination of the prevailing concepts including land-ownership, land-tenureship, state and economy, fiscal policy and taxation. Thus it presents a panoramic revelation of commerce and economics in history with an humble approach of intensifying the cultural heritage of India. Unlike other nations, economic conditions in India have always closely been interwoven with her socio-cultural fabric throughout the pages of history. In modern times, to speak of 'pure economics' in India will be a misnomer to a large extent. In this light, the present work should not only be looked with an academician's eye, but also from the point of view of those whose interest of study lie in researches of history as it envisage to unveil the spheres of economics and planning in modern times.",UOM:39015029089581,False,False,200,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c87sAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1993

Despite a long tradition and variety of forms of public history, the very term ""public history"", or literally speaking ""history in the public sphere"", has been in use in Poland only since the 2010s. This edited collection contains chapters that focus on numerous practices and media forms in public history including historical memory, heritage tourism, historical re-enactments, memes and graphic novels, films, archives, archaeology and oral history. As such, the volume brings together the Polish experiences to wider international audiences and shares Polish controversies related to public history within the academic discourse, beyond media news and politically engaged commentaries. Furthermore, it sheds crucial light on the developments of collective memory, historical and political debates, the history of Poland and East-Central Europe, and the politics of post-World War Two and post-communist societies.

This scattershot approach can propagate bias and misconceptions that inhibit students’ abilities to examine this vitally important part of the world. Understanding and Teaching the Modern Middle East moves away from the Orientalist frameworks that have dominated the West’s understanding of the region, offering a range of fresh interpretations and approaches for teachers. The volume brings together experts on the rich intellectual, cultural, social, and political history of the Middle East, providing necessary historical context to familiarize teachers with the latest scholarship. Each chapter includes easy- to-explore sources to supplement any curriculum, focusing on valuable and controversial themes that may prove pedagogically challenging, including colonization and decolonization, the 1979 Iranian revolution, and the US-led “war on terror.” By presenting multiple viewpoints, the book will function as a springboard for instructors hoping to encourage students to negotiate the various contradictions in historical study.","9780299327606, 0299327604",False,False,388,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pQ8CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2020

Braddock Clarke, Ryoko Yamanaka Kondo",Bloomsbury Publishing,"With over 200 color illustrations, Byzantine Silk on the Silk Roads examines in detail the eclectic iconography of the Byzantine period and its impact on design and creativity today. Through an examination of the extraordinary variety of designs in these captivating silks, an international team of experts reveal that Byzantine culture was ever-moving and open to diverse influences across the length of the Silk Road. Commentaries from curators at key collections – including the Museum of Arts, Boston, the Smithsonian (Cooper Hewitt), the V&A and the Vatican – reveal the spread of silk embroidery and designs from East to West, and from West to East, from China to Rome, and from Constantinople to Korea. Drawing on exclusive imagery from worldwide collections within museums, churches and archives as case studies, their analysis of these unique woven silks explores the relationship between color and power, material culture and status, and offers broader insight into Byzantine culture, trade, society and ceremony. Byzantine Silk ... takes us on a journey from the past to the present, too, where Byzantine story-telling and image-making is revisited, through color, imagery and pattern, in contemporary fashion collections. Exploring Byzantine culture through a contemporary filter, the book shows how the Byzantine era still influences textile and fashion designers today in their choices of materials and colors, and their utilization of images and patterns, acting as a unique source of inspiration to designers and creators in the 21st century.","9781350099326, 1350099325",True,True,401,Design,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bPR-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3209,INR,3209,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bPR-EAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-bPR-EAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022

9TgtAAAAQBAJ,history,Civilian Warriors,The Inside Story of Blackwater and the Unsung Heroes of the War on Terror,Erik Prince,Penguin,"No company in our time has been as mysterious or as controversial as Blackwater. Founded by former Navy SEAL Erik Prince in 1997, it recruited special forces veterans and others with the skills and courage to take on the riskiest security jobs in the world. As its reputation grew, government demand for its services escalated, and Blackwater's men eventually completed nearly one hundred thousand missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Both the Bush and Obama administrations found the company indispensible. It sounds like a classic startup success story, except for one problem: Blackwater has been demonized around the world. From uninformed news coverage to grossly distorted fictional portrayals, Blackwater employees have been smeared as mercenaries, profiteers, jackbooted thugs, and worse. Because of the secrecy requirements of Blackwater's contracts with the Pentagon, the State Department, and the CIA, Prince was unable to speak out when his company's opponents spread false information. But now he's able to tell the full and often shocking story of Blackwater's rise and fall. In Civilian Warriors, Prince pulls no punches and spares no details. He explains his original goal of building an elite center for military and law enforcement training. He recounts how the company shifted gears after 9/11. He honors our troops while challenging the Pentagon's top leadership. And he reveals why highly efficient private military contractors have been essential to running our armed forces, since long before Blackwater came along. Above all, Prince debunks myths about Blackwater that spread while he was forced to remain silent-myths that tarnished the memory of men who gave their lives for their country but never got the recognition they deserved. He reveals new information about some of the biggest controversies of the War on Terror, including: • The true story of the Nisour Square massacre in Baghdad. • The actual details of Blackwater's so-called impunity in Iraq. • The events leading up to the televised deaths of Blackwater contractors in Fallujah. Prince doesn't pretend to be perfect, and he doesn't hide the sometimes painful details of his private life. But he has done a great public service by setting the record straight. His book reads like a thriller but is too improbable to be fiction.","9780698154001, 0698154002",True,False,390,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9TgtAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,513.75,INR,256.88,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9TgtAAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-9TgtAAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2013

jE1tDwAAQBAJ,history,Indians,A Brief History of A Civilization,Namit Arora,Penguin Random House India Private Limited,"What do we really know about the Aryan migration theory and why is that debate so hot? Why did the people of Khajuraho carve erotic scenes on their temple walls? What did the monks at Nalanda eat for dinner? Did our ideals of beauty ever prefer dark skin? Indian civilization is an idea, a reality, an enigma. In this riveting book, Namit Arora takes us on an unforgettable journey through 5000 years of history, reimagining in rich detail the social and cultural moorings of Indians through the ages. Drawing on credible sources, he discovers what inspired and shaped them: their political upheavals and rivalries, customs and vocations, and a variety of unusual festivals. Arora makes a stop at six iconic places -- the Harappan city of Dholavira, the Ikshvaku capital at Nagarjunakonda, the Buddhist centre of learning at Nalanda, enigmatic Khajuraho, Vijayanagar at Hampi, and historic Varanasi -- enlivening the narrative with vivid descriptions, local stories and evocative photographs. Punctuating this are chronicles of famous travellers who visited India -- including Megasthenes, Xuanzang, Alberuni and Marco Polo -- whose dramatic and idiosyncratic tales conceal surprising insights about our land. In lucid, elegant prose, Arora explores the exciting churn of ideas, beliefs and values of our ancestors through millennia -- some continue to shape modern India, while others have been lost forever. An original, deeply engaging and extensively researched work, Indians illuminates a range of histories coursing through our veins.","9789353052874, 9353052874",True,True,381,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jE1tDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,538.08,INR,269.04,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jE1tDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-jE1tDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021
bjqhEAAAQBAJ,history,Education for Extinction,"American Indians and the Boarding School Experience, 1875–1928. Second Edition, Revised and Expanded",David Wallace Adams,University Press of Kansas,"The last ""Indian War"" was fought against Native American children in the dormitories and classrooms of government boarding schools. Only by removing Indian children from their homes for extended periods of time, policymakers reasoned, could white ""civilization"" take root while childhood memories of ""savagism"" gradually faded to the point of extinction. In the words of one official: ""Kill the Indian and save the man."" This fully revised edition of Education for Extinction offers the only comprehensive account of this dispiriting effort, and incorporates the last twenty-five years of scholarship. Much more than a study of federal Indian policy, this book vividly details the day-to-day experiences of Indian youth living in a ""total institution"" designed to reconstruct them both psychologically and culturally. The assault on identity came in many forms: the shearing off of braids, the assignment of new names, uniformed drill routines, humiliating punishments, relentless attacks on native religious beliefs, patriotic indoctrinations, suppression of tribal languages, Victorian gender rituals, football contests, and industrial training. Especially poignant is Adams's description of the ways in which students resisted or accommodated themselves to forced assimilation. Many converted to varying degrees, but others plotted escapes, committed arson, and devised ingenious strategies of passive resistance. Adams also argues that many of those who seemingly cooperated with the system were more than passive players in this drama, that the response of accommodation was not synonymous with cultural surrender. This is especially apparent in his analysis of students who returned to the reservation. He reveals the various ways in which graduates struggled to make sense of their lives and selectively drew upon their school experience in negotiating personal and tribal survival in a world increasingly dominated by white men. The discussion comes full circle when Adams reviews the government's gradual retreat from the assimilationist vision. Partly because of persistent student resistance, but also partly because of a complex and sometimes contradictory set of progressive, humanitarian, and racist motivations, policymakers did eventually come to view boarding schools less enthusiastically. Based upon extensive use of government archives, Indian and teacher autobiographies, and school newspapers, Adams's moving account is essential reading for scholars and general readers alike interested in Western history, Native American studies, American race relations, education history, and multiculturalism.","9780700629602, 0700629602",False,True,488,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bjqhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2020

oG-DDwAAQBAJ,history,The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee,,David Treuer,Hachette UK,"FINALIST FOR THE 2019 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD CHOSEN BY BARACK OBAMA AS ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE BOOKS OF 2019 LONGLISTED FOR THE 2020 ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL FOR EXCELLENCE A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER 'An informed, moving and kaleidoscopic portrait... Treuer's powerful book suggests the need for soul-searching about the meanings of American history and the stories we tell ourselves about this nation's past' New York Times Book Review, front page The received idea of Native American history has been that American Indian history essentially ended with the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. Not only did one hundred fifty Sioux die at the hands of the U.S. Cavalry, the sense was, but Native civilization did as well. Growing up Ojibwe on a reservation in Minnesota, training as an anthropologist, and researching Native life past and present for his nonfiction and novels, David Treuer has uncovered a different narrative. Because they did not disappear - and not despite but rather because of their intense struggles to preserve their language, their traditions, their families, and their very existence- the story of American Indians since the end of the nineteenth century to the present is one of unprecedented resourcefulness and reinvention. In The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, Treuer melds history with reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes' distinctive cultures from first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put the lie to the myth that Indians don't know or care about property.

NlgMEAAAQBAJ,history,Ancestral Presence,Cosmology and Historical Experience in the Papuan Highlands,Eric Hirsch,Routledge,"Ancestral Presence tells a history that has more than one history in it while also telling the story of the relation between worlds. For the Fuyuge people of the Papuan highlands, the past is not ‘history’ in a conventional sense. For them, the world and its history derive from a creator force called Tidibe which is central to Fuyuge cosmology: the Fuyuge are at the ‘centre of the world’. But Fuyuge people are part of another history, too: they have experienced decades of mission and government influence from centres of power located elsewhere, to which their mountain home is marginal and remote. Through a detailed exploration of Fuyuge myth, changes to ritual life and cosmology, Eric Hirsch weaves an account of the relationship between these two histories. He documents the real changes wrought by colonialism, government and Christianity from the late nineteenth century to the turn of the millennium. Yet this is not a story of ‘continuity and change’. Hirsch demonstrates how transformation was always central to Fuyuge life: changes brought by missionaries and government were processes they themselves initiated in the ancestral past through Tidibe, the cosmological creator force. Engaging in debates that have been pivotal to Melanesian anthropology, the book presents an ethnographically rich account of a distinctive world, cosmology and ideas of historical change. It also raises questions regarding assumptions central to Western History, its worldview and ideas of historical time.","9781000293869, 1000293866",True,True,255,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NlgMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3138.8,INR,3138.8,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NlgMEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-NlgMEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020

WXBDEAAAQBAJ,history,Nehru,The Debates that Defined India,"Adeel Hussain, Tripurdaman Singh",Harper Collins,"From being elected as Congress president in 1929 till his death in 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru remained a towering figure in Indian politics, a man who left an indelible stamp on the history of South Asia. As a leading light of the nationalist struggle and as India's first and longest-serving prime minister, his ideas shaped the political contours of the country and left an imprint so deep that his legacy continues to be debated furiously today. In life, as in afterlife, Nehru was many things to many people. Going beyond the imposed labels of contemporary discourse, this book illuminates four encounters that Nehru had with contemporaries from across the political spectrum - Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Sardar Patel and Syama Prasad Mookerjee - that are critical to understanding his ideas, and his long afterlife and impress on the present. Nehru may no longer be alive to answer his critics today, but there was a time when he pitted himself vigorously against his opponents in the marketplace of ideas, debating the most profound questions in South Asian history and decisively influencing political events. It is this intellectually combative Nehru whom we meet in this book - voicing ideological disagreements, forging political alliances, moulding political opinion, offering visions of the future and staking out the political field - a key figure in the debates that defined India","9789354228209, 9354228208",True,False,236,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WXBDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,479,INR,335.3,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WXBDEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-WXBDEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021

It revolves around the following questions: What kinds of experiences have engendered national mobilization and feelings of national belonging? How have political and societal conflicts turned into new communities of experience and emotion? What kinds of experiences have been integrated into, or excluded from, the national context in different instances? How have people internalized or contested the nation as a context for their personal, family and minority-group experiences? In what ways has the nation entered and affected people’s intimate spheres of life? How have “national” experiences been transmitted to children in the renewal of the nation? This edited collection points to the histories of experience and emotions as a novel way of studying nations and nationalism. Building on current debates in nationalism studies, it offers a theoretical framework for analyzing the historical construction of “lived nations,” and introduces a number of new methodological approaches to understand the experiences of the nation, extending from the investigation of personal reminiscences and music records to the study of dreams and children’s drawings.","9783030698829, 3030698823",True,True,397,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KDYyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,0,INR,0,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KDYyEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-KDYyEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021

Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women’s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson’s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear—a struggle that continues even now. While the American story has not always—or even often—been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us, “The good news is that we have come through such darkness before”—as, time and again, Lincoln’s better angels have found a way to prevail.","9780399589812, 0399589813",False,False,417,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m9JVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

0VuvxbAdvPMC,history,Ancient India,In Historical Outline,Dwijendra Narayan Jha,Manohar Publishers,"This book is a substantially modified and enlarged version of the author's ""Ancient India: An Introductory Outline"" (Delhi, 1977) and surveys the major developments in India's social, economic and cultural history up to the end of the ancient period and the beginning of the early middle ages and explains the rise and growth of states with reference to their material basis. Special attention has been paid to the elements of change and continuity in society, economy and culture, and to the changing forms of exploitation and consequent social tensions as well as to the role of religion and superstition in society. The book demolishes the popular historiographical stereotypes created by the Hindu-chauvinist communal writings. It also gives the lie to the view that the Indian society has been stagnant and changeless -- a view which was propagated by Western scholars in the heyday of British imperialism and continues to be peddled ingeniously in our own times. The assassination of Mahatma Gandhi ... and the demolition of the Baburi Masjid are two ... unforgettable milestones in the unfolding of the backward-looking Hindu revivalist and fascist politics of contemporary India. Since both Harappa and Mohenjodaro are situated now in Pakistan, the Hindu revivalists are busy locating the epicentre of the Harappan culture in the elusive Saraswati valley.","8173042853, 9788173042850",False,False,220,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0VuvxbAdvPMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,1,1,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1999

ScYJAQAAQBAJ,history,The Past Before Us,Historical Traditions of Early North India,Romila Thapar,Harvard University Press,"The claim, often made, that India--uniquely among civilizations--lacks historical writing distracts us from a more pertinent question, according to Romila Thapar: how to recognize the historical sense of societies whose past is recorded in ways very different from European conventions. In The Past Before Us, a distinguished scholar of ancient India guides us through a panoramic survey of the historical traditions of North India. Thapar reveals a deep and sophisticated consciousness of history embedded in the diverse body of classical Indian literature. The history recorded in such texts as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata is less concerned with authenticating persons and events than with presenting a picture of traditions striving to retain legitimacy and continuity amid social change. Spanning an epoch of nearly twenty-five hundred years, from 1000 BCE to 1400 CE, Thapar delineates three distinct historical traditions: an Itihasa-Purana tradition of Brahman authors; a tradition composed mainly by Buddhist and Jaina scholars; and a popular bardic tradition. The Vedic corpus, the epics, the Buddhist canon and monastic chronicles, inscriptions, regional accounts, and royal biographies and dramas are all scrutinized afresh--not as sources to be mined for factual data but as genres that disclose how Indians of ancient times represented their own past to themselves.","9780674726529, 0674726529",True,True,915,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ScYJAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,3640.96,INR,3640.96,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ScYJAQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ScYJAQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2013

MlXlEAAAQBAJ,history,"""The Gunny Sack"" by M. G. Vassanji. A review of the most important topics",,,GRIN Verlag,"Essay from the year 2022 in the subject African Studies - Literature, grade: 13, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Anglistik), course: An Introducton to African Diasporic Literature in English: Mobility, Migration, and Cultural Shifts, language: English, abstract: After a short Summary, this paper deals with the themes of travelling memory and history; diaspora, displacement & diasporic imagination; cross-cultural encounters; role of the woman/gender role; and travel and mobility. Each topic has been written in the form of an essay and works closely with the novel ""The Gunny Sack"", i.e. the individual examples per topic are supported by text excerpts. Excerpt from an essay that deals with the topic of ""Traveling Memory and History"": In his novel ""The Gunny Sack"", M.G. Vassanji depicts the family history of Salim, whose family is in constant movement as they move from one place to another, constantly accompanied by historical events. This essay seeks to investigate the theme of travel-memory and history through a series of examples. The novel focuses on the impact of history and how history affects the present. In ""The Gunny Sack"", the narrator Salim Juma unpacks his family history, and thus he uncovers the past with all its attendant features. Be it the political history of East Africa or the riddles of memories. [...] It can thus be assumed that family history serves as an extension of political history. Furthermore, memory as a narrative device also builds a bridge between the past, present and future, as Salim emphasizes that history must not repeat itself and fervently hopes that he will be the last migrant from his family. [...] However, the past, which is largely in the gunny sack, should never be forgotten. In addition, Vassanji tends to preserve collective memory and present it through the experiences of individuals. The gunny sack contains many mementos, each of which tells a chapter of his family's history. ""The Gunny Sack"" is both a story about the arrival and life of an extended family in East Africa and a repository for the collective memory and life stories of many other Asian-Africans.","9783346975164, 3346975169",False,True,14,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MlXlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,642.79,INR,321.4,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MlXlEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-MlXlEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2023
WF1gEAAAQBAJ,history,Queens of Jerusalem,The Women Who Dared to Rule,Katherine Pangonis,Weidenfeld & Nicolson,"In 1187 Saladin's armies besieged the holy city of Jerusalem. He had previously annihilated Jerusalem's army at the battle of Hattin, and behind the city's high walls a last-ditch defence was being led by an unlikely trio - including Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem. They could not resist Saladin, but, if they were lucky, they could negotiate terms that would save the lives of the city's inhabitants. Queen Sibylla was the last of a line of formidable female rulers in the Crusader States of Outremer. Yet for all the many books written about the Crusades, one aspect is conspicuously absent: the stories of women. Queens and princesses tend to be presented as passive transmitters of land and royal blood. In reality, women ruled, conducted diplomatic negotiations, made military decisions, forged alliances, rebelled, and undertook architectural projects. Sibylla's grandmother Queen Melisende was the first queen to seize real political agency in Jerusalem and rule in her own right. She outmanoeuvred both her husband and son to seize real power in her kingdom, and was a force to be reckoned with in the politics of the medieval Middle East. The lives of her Armenian mother, her three sisters, and their daughters and granddaughters were no less intriguing. The lives of this trailblazing dynasty of royal women, and the crusading Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, are the focus of Katherine Pangonis's debut book. In QUEENS OF JERUSALEM she explores the role women played in the governing of the Middle East during periods of intense instability, and how they persevered to rule and seize greater power for themselves when the opportunity presented itself.","9781474614108, 1474614108",True,False,325,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WF1gEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2021
c0f7DwAAQBAJ,history,On First Principles,,"Origen,",Wipf and Stock Publishers,"Being Koetschau's text of the De Principiis translated into English, together with an introduction and notes by G. W. Butterworth Origen's On First Principles was the first attempt to formulate a coherent system of Christian philosophy, and also the best expression of the theologian's general opinions. The work is divided into four parts: book one deals with God and creation, book two with creation (rational and irrational natures), providence, and redemption, and book four with the interpretation of Holy Scripture. Origen's views are based upon the authority of the Scriptures and Church tradition, and grounded upon the tenets of Neoplatonism. In On First Principles many maxims are given as to the nature of the Trinity, the person of Christ, and man's free will under the hand of Providence, most of which are considered Orthodox teachings. On the other hand, the principles found in this work that engendered controversy and were later condemned by the Fifth Ecumenical Council in 553, are the preexistence and transmigration of souls, and universal salvation at the consummation of the world. This edition, being Koetschau's English text translated from Rufinus' definitive Latin volume, contains selected fragments of St. Jerome's rendition and the meager remains of the original Greek texts in order to furnish a more comprehensive view of Origen's writings. Also included are in-depth introductions to Origin's life and works by the scholar G. W.

And historical spectres of corruption and disunity, which have brought down many a mighty ruling house, continue to haunt the People’s Republic today. Modern China is seen variously as an economic powerhouse, an icon of urbanisation, a propaganda state or an aggressive superpower seeking world domination.

It also highlights how gun technology and military tactics developed in tandem over time. Centuries ago, the Chinese discovered that if they put gunpowder and a projectile into a metal tube and ignited it, they could fire the projectile with enormous force. The first guns were born. Firearms: An Illustrated History showcases over 300 firearms including pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, machine-guns, and artillery, each with annotated close-up photographs and details of their origins, barrel, and caliber. It details the use of the firearms, not just in the military but for sport, hunting, and law enforcement. This comprehensive volume traces the history of firearms, highlighting ""turning points"" such as the rifle with its parallel spiraled groves that could impart a spin to bullets making them fly straighter. It also showcases iconic firearms such as the Walther PPK self-loading pistol popularised in James Bond films.

DlHUDwAAQBAJ,history,Say Nothing,A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland,Patrick Radden Keefe,Vintage,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NOW AN FX LIMITED SERIES STREAMING ON HULU • NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD WINNER • From the author of Empire of Pain—a stunning, intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussions. One of The New York Times’s 20 Best Books of the 21st Century ""Masked intruders dragged Jean McConville, a 38-year-old widow and mother of 10, from her Belfast home in 1972. In this meticulously reported book—as finely paced as a novel—Keefe uses McConville's murder as a prism to tell the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Interviewing people on both sides of the conflict, he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing, utterly gripping saga."" —New York Times Book Review ""Reads like a novel ... Keefe is ... a master of narrative nonfiction. . .An incredible story.""—Rolling Stone A Best Book of the Year: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, TIME, NPR, and more! Jean McConville's abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes. Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders. From radical and impetuous I.R.A. terrorists such as Dolours Price, who, when she was barely out of her teens, was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as The Dark, to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army, to Gerry Adams, who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his I.R.A. past--Say Nothing conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.","9780307279286, 0307279286",False,False,561,True Crime,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DlHUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2020
CtQvEAAAQBAJ,history,Space Forces,A Critical History of Life in Outer Space,Fred Scharmen,Verso Books,"The radical history of space exploration from the Russian Cosmists to Elon Musk Many societies have imagined going to live in space. What they want to do once they get up there - whether conquering the unknown, establishing space ""colonies,"" privatising the moon's resources - reveals more than expected. In this fascinating radical history of space exploration, Fred Scharmen shows that often science and fiction have combined in the imagined dreams of life in outer space, but these visions have real implications for life back on earth. For the Russian Cosmists of the 1890s space was a place to pursue human perfection away from the Earth. For others, such as Wernher Von Braun, it was an engineering task that combined, in the Space Race, the Cold War, and during World War II, with destructive geopolitics. Arthur C. Clark in his speculative books offered an alternative vision of wonder that is indifferent to human interaction. Meanwhile NASA planned and managed the space station like an earthbound corporation. Today, the market has arrived into outer space and exploration is the plaything of superrich technology billionaires, who plan to privatise the mineral wealth for themselves. Are other worlds really possible? Bringing these figures and ideas together reveals a completely different story of our relationship with outer space, as well as the dangers of our current direction of extractive capitalism and colonisation.","9781786637345, 1786637340",True,False,273,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CtQvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2021

She reveals the tremendous efforts that were made to transform attitudes and feelings, as well as daily life. After addressing the first British Women’s Liberation Conference at Ruskin College, Oxford in 1970, she went on to encourage night cleaners to unionise, to campaign for nurseries and abortion rights. She played an influential role in discussions of socialist feminist ideas and her books and journalism attracted an international readership. Written with generosity and humour Daring to Hope recreates grassroots networks, communal houses and squats, bringing alive a shared impetus to organise collectively and to love without jealousy or domination. It conveys the shifts occurring in politics and society through kernels of personal experience. The result is a book about liberation in the widest sense.","9781839763892, 1839763892",False,False,353,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q6FHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2021

Its subject is the fate of one of the world's greatest civilizations over thirteen centuries - its rulers, wars and society, and the events that led to its disastrous collapse. Here, in volumes three and four, Gibbon vividly recounts the waves of barbarian invaders under commanders such as Alaric and Attila, who overran and eventually destroyed the West. He then turns his gaze to events in the East, where even the achievements of the Byzantine emperor Justinian and the campaigns of the brilliant military leader Belisarius could not conceal the fundamental weaknesses of their empire.

uPzKswEACAAJ,history,The New History,,Alun Munslow,Routledge,"The notion of 'history' has always been one strenuously debated by both academics and the wider population. This deeply provocative re-thinking of our engagement with the past by one of the world's leading post-modern historians takes that debate one step further. Alun Munslow re-assesses history in the light of post-modernism and other intellectual challenges which have questioned the primacy of the modernist epistemology of empiricism. In an original and stimulating vision of history that will intrigue all those seriously interested in the subject, Munslow argues that history is not only about the sources, but a literary construction. Munslow concludes that history, as a cultural narrative about the past can never tell us what the past really means. This far reaching conclusion is based on the radical idea that the content of history is defined as much by the nature of the language used to represent and interpret that content as it is by research into the sources. This suggests that history does not produce the most likely meaning of the past but rather can only generate alternative meanings. The lead volume in a major new series on historical thinking and practice, this is an accessible yet absorbing study that breaks new ground in discussing the stage history is at now, and perhaps most engagingly, the direction it will take in the future.","1138158208, 9781138158207",False,False,244,,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uPzKswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2017

2uQfzAEACAAJ,history,The Code of Hammurabi,,Hammurabi,,"The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code of ancient Mesopotamia, dating back to about 1754 BC. It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a man-sized stone stele and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" (lex talionis) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man. Nearly one-half of the Code deals with matters of contract, establishing, for example, the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and sexual behavior. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently. A few provisions address issues related to military service. Hammurabi ruled for nearly 42 years, c. 1792 to 1750 BC according to the Middle chronology. In the preface to the law, he states, ""Anu and Bel called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared Marduk, the patron god of Babylon (The Human Record, Andrea & Overfield 2005), to bring about the rule in the land."" On the stone slab there are 44 columns and 28 paragraphs that contained 282 laws. The laws follow along the rules of 'an eye for an eye'.","6057748816, 9786057748812",False,False,44,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2uQfzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2019

But the book also writes with feeling and sensitivity about lesser-known (though not necessarily less important) Indians--peasants, tribals, women, workers, and musicians.

xERdEAAAQBAJ,history,"Coffeehouse Culture in the Atlantic World, 1650-1789",,E. Wesley Reynolds,Bloomsbury Publishing,"This book argues that coffeehouses and the coffee trade were central to the making of the Atlantic world in the century leading up to the American Revolution. Fostering international finance and commerce, spreading transatlantic news, building military might, determining political fortunes and promoting status and consumption, coffeehouses created a web of social networks stretching from Britain to its colonies in North America. As polite alternatives to taverns, coffeehouses have been hailed as 'penny universities'; a place for political discussion by the educated and elite. Reynolds shows that they were much more than this. Coffeehouse Culture in the Atlantic World 1650-1789, reveals that they simultaneously created a network for marine insurance and naval protection, led to calls for a free press, built tension between trade lobbyists and the East India Company, and raised questions about gender, respectability and the polite middling class. It demonstrates how coffeehouses served to create transatlantic connections between metropole Britain and her North American colonies and played an important role in the revolution and protest movements that followed.","9781350247239, 1350247235",False,True,265,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xERdEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2794,INR,2794,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xERdEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-xERdEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022

fjhaEAAAQBAJ,history,"Race, Place, Trace",Essays in Honour of Patrick Wolfe,"Lorenzo Veracini, Susan Slyomovics",Verso Books,"This edited collection celebrates Patrick Wolfe's contribution to the study and critique of settler colonialism as a distinct mode of domination. The chapters collected here focus on the settler-colonial assimilation of land and people, and on what Wolfe insightfully defined as 'preaccumulation': the ability of settlers to mobilise technologies and resources unavailable to resisting Indigenous communities. Wolfe's militant and interdisciplinary scholarship is thus emphasised, together with his determination to acknowledge Indigenous perspectives and the efficacy of Indigenous resistances. In case studies of Australia, French Algeria, and the United States, contributors illustrate how seminal his contribution was and is. There are three core reasons why it is especially important to develop the field of thinking inaugurated by Wolfe: first, because the demand for Indigenous sovereignty has been crucial to recent struggles against neoliberal attacks in the settler societies; second, because a critique of settler colonialism and its logic of elimination has supported important struggles against environmental devastation; and third, because the ability to think race in ways that are not disconnected from other struggles is now more needed than ever. Racial capitalism and settler colonialism are as imbricated now as they always have been, and keeping both in mind at the same time highlights the need to establish and nurture solidarities that reach across established divides.","9781839766152, 1839766158",True,False,245,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fjhaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2022
mRNSDwAAQBAJ,history,Geopolitics. A historical review,,Jean Cédric Obame Emane,GRIN Verlag,"Essay from the year 2016 in the subject Politics - Basics and General, grade: A, ( Atlantic International University ), course: Geopolitics, language: English, abstract: To begin with, we would like to highlight that doing research on geopolitics has brought us to go deeper into a certain literature that enabled us to understand from the very beginning what geopolitics was meant for. The literature we have used consists of two categories, books relative to the latest changes on the discipline; we mean geopolitics in the present. The other literature is concerned with books of the 1990s with some authors like Ó Tuathail, Dalby and others, books that give a historical perspective of geopolitics. Furthermore, we believe that for a discipline like geopolitics that we have never studied in our previous university studies, we did not just need to make a good assignment and that is all, but also to acquire tools that might help us to be knowledgeable in that coursework. For this reason, we needed to read books that analyze and explain what the essence of geopolitics is. Our basic thesis statement is that the geographical conditions of a country, this is to say that its endowment in natural resources can have an impact on its geopolitical orientation, which is its foreign policy. In other words, geographical conditions influence a country’s foreign policy or attitude in international affairs. This we will provide an example with Gabon, our home country.","9783668663213, 3668663211",False,True,35,Political Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mRNSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1691.95,INR,1691.95,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mRNSDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-mRNSDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2018

A thousand eyes see all I do.' Elizabeth I The Tudor monarchs were constantly surrounded by an army of attendants, courtiers and ministers. Even in their most private moments, they were accompanied by a servant specifically appointed for the task. A groom of the stool would stand patiently by as Henry VIII performed his daily purges, and when Elizabeth I retired for the evening, one of her female servants would sleep at the end of her bed. These attendants knew the truth behind the glamorous exterior. They saw the tears shed by Henry VII upon the death of his son Arthur. They knew the tragic secret behind 'Bloody' Mary's phantom pregnancies. And they saw the 'crooked carcass' beneath Elizabeth I's carefully applied makeup, gowns and accessories. It is the accounts of these eyewitnesses, as well as a rich array of other contemporary sources that historian Tracy Borman has examined more closely than ever before. With new insights and discoveries, and in the same way that she brilliantly illuminated the real Thomas Cromwell - The Private Life of the Tudors will reveal previously unexamined details about the characters we think we know so well. ---- Critical acclaim for The Private Lives of the Tudors: 'Borman approaches her topic with huge enthusiasm and a keen eye for entertaining...this is a very human story of a remarkable family, full of vignettes that sit long in the mind.' Dan Jones, The Sunday Times 'Tracy Borman's eye for detail is impressive; the book is packed with fascinating courtly minutiae... this is a wonderful book.' The Times 'Borman is an authoritative and engaging writer, good at prising out those humanising details that make the past alive to us.' The Observer 'Fascinating, detailed account of the everyday reality of the royals... This is a book of rich scholarship.' Daily Mail 'Tracy Borman's passion for the Tudor period shines forth from the pages of this fascinatingly detailed book, which vividly illuminates what went on behind the scenes at the Tudor court.'

KgTZGznktIgC,history,Pop Art,A Critical History,Steven Henry Madoff,University of California Press,"Pop Art: A Critical History chronicles one of the most controversial art movements of the century. The anthology draws from a great range of sources, from the leading art magazines and art historical journals to newspapers and news magazines such as the New York Times, Life, and Newsweek. What emerges from this rich cross-section of critical and journalistic commentary is a fascinating view of the tumultuous rise of Pop art and its establishment as a major force in contemporary art. A broad selection of articles traces the emergence of the movement itself in England and America, as seen through the eyes of the working critics of the day. The focus then narrows to present in-depth writings on the four major Pop artists: Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol, along with an examination of many other artists involved in the movement. From reviews of the very first shows of many of these artists to interviews with them, to news stories about their collectors and their lifestyles, Pop Art: A Critical History represents the most complete and coherent record of Pop art yet published. The book concludes with an invaluable chronology of the major '60s exhibitions by Pop artists. Among the contributors are Lawrence Alloway, John Coplans, Donald Judd, Max Kozloff, Gerald Nordland, Peter Plagens, Barbara Rose, Robert Rosenblum, John Russell, Gene Swenson, and Sidney Tillim.","0520212436, 9780520212435",False,False,452,Art,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KgTZGznktIgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1997

LeCain,Cambridge University Press,"New insights into the microbiome, epigenetics, and cognition are radically challenging our very idea of what it means to be 'human', while an explosion of neo-materialist thinking in the humanities has fostered a renewed appreciation of the formative powers of a dynamic material environment. The Matter of History brings these scientific and humanistic ideas together to develop a bold, new post-anthropocentric understanding of the past, one that reveals how powerful organisms and things help to create humans in all their dimensions, biological, social, and cultural. Timothy J. LeCain combines cutting-edge theory and detailed empirical analysis to explain the extraordinary late-nineteenth century convergence between the United States and Japan at the pivotal moment when both were emerging as global superpowers. Illustrating the power of a deeply material social and cultural history, The Matter of History argues that three powerful things - cattle, silkworms, and copper - helped to drive these previously diverse nations towards a global 'Great Convergence'.","1107592704, 9781107592704",False,False,358,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pg-ErgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2017

Choices were frequent and numerous. Different outcomes - liberation or barbarism - were often possible. Rejecting the top-down approach of conventional history, Faulkner contends that it is the mass action of ordinary people that drives great events.At the beginning of the 21st century - with economic disaster, war, climate catastrophe and deep class divisions - humans face perhaps the greatest crisis in the long history of our species. The lesson of A Marxist History of the World is that, since we created our past, we can also create a better future.","0745332145, 9780745332147",False,False,0,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H59ULwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2013

fjhaEAAAQBAJ,history,"Race, Place, Trace",Essays in Honour of Patrick Wolfe,"Lorenzo Veracini, Susan Slyomovics",Verso Books,"This edited collection celebrates Patrick Wolfe's contribution to the study and critique of settler colonialism as a distinct mode of domination. The chapters collected here focus on the settler-colonial assimilation of land and people, and on what Wolfe insightfully defined as 'preaccumulation': the ability of settlers to mobilise technologies and resources unavailable to resisting Indigenous communities. Wolfe's militant and interdisciplinary scholarship is thus emphasised, together with his determination to acknowledge Indigenous perspectives and the efficacy of Indigenous resistances. In case studies of Australia, French Algeria, and the United States, contributors illustrate how seminal his contribution was and is. There are three core reasons why it is especially important to develop the field of thinking inaugurated by Wolfe: first, because the demand for Indigenous sovereignty has been crucial to recent struggles against neoliberal attacks in the settler societies; second, because a critique of settler colonialism and its logic of elimination has supported important struggles against environmental devastation; and third, because the ability to think race in ways that are not disconnected from other struggles is now more needed than ever. Racial capitalism and settler colonialism are as imbricated now as they always have been, and keeping both in mind at the same time highlights the need to establish and nurture solidarities that reach across established divides.","9781839766152, 1839766158",True,False,245,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fjhaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2022

Choices were frequent and numerous. Different outcomes - liberation or barbarism - were often possible. Rejecting the top-down approach of conventional history, Faulkner contends that it is the mass action of ordinary people that drives great events.At the beginning of the 21st century - with economic disaster, war, climate catastrophe and deep class divisions - humans face perhaps the greatest crisis in the long history of our species. The lesson of A Marxist History of the World is that, since we created our past, we can also create a better future.","0745332145, 9780745332147",False,False,0,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H59ULwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2013

uzk2DwAAQBAJ,history,Cutaneous Malignancies,A Surgical Perspective,Brian Gastman,Thieme,"The treatment of skin cancer has become an increasingly multispecialty practice. Ongoing surgical and postsurgical advances and emergent factors that predispose patients to these tumors have changed the treatment paradigm. Having a keen understanding of diagnostic, surgical, and nonsurgical treatment options is key to identifying, treating, or referring patients with potential cutaneous malignancies. While Brian R. Gastman's Cutaneous Malignancies: A Surgical Perspective is the first of its kind to emphasize surgical management of skin cancer, several sections are devoted to systemic nonsurgical therapies affecting patient care and surgical intervention. Topics encompassed include prevention, diagnosis, medication management, appropriate margin size, reconstruction methods, and the importance of stellar dermatopathology. Key Highlights The role of Mohs micrographic surgery and radiation in skin cancer treatment Treatment approaches for the two most common forms of skin cancer respectively, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma Surgical treatment of cutaneous malignant melanoma and other high-risk malignancies Clinical insights on completion lymphadenectomy and sentinel node biopsy for melanoma, two topics rarely addressed in context with skin cancer Diagnosis and treatment of rare malignancies including Merkel cell carcinoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, cutaneous angiosarcoma, and cutaneous leiomyosarcoma More than 400 high-quality illustrations further delineate surgical modalities Edited by an esteemed dual board certified plastic surgeon and otolaryngologist, this definitive book is the most complete guide to surgical management of skin cancer.

He maps out recurring phenomena in the history of ideas, which the essays illustrate. One phenomenon is the presence and influence of the same presuppositions or other operative ""ideas"" in very diverse provinces of thought and in different periods. Another is the role of semantic transitions and confusions, of shifts and of ambiguities in the meanings of terms, in the history of thought and taste. A third phenomenon is the internal tensions or waverings in the mind of almost every individual writer—sometimes discernible even in a single writing or on a single page—arising from conflicting ideas or incongruous propensities of feeling or taste to which the writer is susceptible.

vqZJDwAAQBAJ,history,Skin in the Game,Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Random House,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A bold work from the author of The Black Swan that challenges many of our long-held beliefs about risk and reward, politics and religion, finance and personal responsibility In his most provocative and practical book yet, one of the foremost thinkers of our time redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contribute to a fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life. As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights: • For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations. • Ethical rules aren’t universal. You’re part of a group larger than you, but it’s still smaller than humanity in general. • Minorities, not majorities, run the world. The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others. • You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot. “Educated philistines” have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets. • Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find). A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines. • True religion is commitment, not just faith. How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you’re willing to risk for it. The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, “The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.”","9780425284629, 042528462X",False,False,305,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vqZJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

Most historians study the smallest slivers of time, emphasizing specific dates, individuals, and documents. But what would it look like to study the whole of history, from the big bang through the present day -- and even into the remote future? How would looking at the full span of time change the way we perceive the universe, the earth, and our very existence? These were the questions David Christian set out to answer when he created the field of ""Big History,"" the most exciting new approach to understanding where we have been, where we are, and where we are going. In Origin Story, Christian takes readers on a wild ride through the entire 13.8 billion years we've come to know as ""history."" By focusing on defining events (thresholds), major trends, and profound questions about our origins, Christian exposes the hidden threads that tie everything together -- from the creation of the planet to the advent of agriculture, nuclear war, and beyond. With stunning insights into the origin of the universe, the beginning of life, the emergence of humans, and what the future might bring, Origin Story boldly reframes our place in the cosmos.","0316392006, 9780316392006",False,False,0,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c-5WswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

Media from Newsweek to Black News Tonight covered it, and the book shot up bestsellers lists at the New York Times, Bookshop.org, Amazon, and elsewhere. Now this ""pugnacious and entertaining critique of conservative interpretations of the Constitution"" (Publishers Weekly) is available in an affordable paperback edition. In chapters ranging from ""Why You Can't Punch a Cop"" and ""It's Not Unusual to Be Cruel"" to ""Everything You Know About the Second Amendment Is Wrong"" and ""The Abortion Chapter,"" the legal commentator that Samantha Bee calls ""irrepressible and righteously indignant"" weighs in on every hot-button issue facing the country (and the Supreme Court) today. As the New York Journal of Books observed, ""It is impossible to enjoy reading the Constitution more than through the searing perspective of the brilliant Twainesque humor of Elie Mystal in Allow Me to Retort."" Called ""the funniest lawyer in America"" by Matt Levine of Bloomberg Opinion, Mystal brings the same tactics he uses to defend the idea of a fair and equal society on MSNBC and CNN to what Washington Lawyer calls a ""witty, profane, and well-argued"" book that lays bare the truth of the Republican project to keep America forever tethered to its slaveholding past.","162097763X, 9781620977637",False,False,0,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LexEzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2023

uqAGCD2V8yQC,history,Mothers of All Children,Women Reformers and the Rise of Juvenile Courts in Progressive Era America,Elizabeth Jane Clapp,Penn State University Press,"A history of the juvenile court movement in America, which focuses upon the central but neglected contribution of women reformers.The establishment of juvenile courts in cities across the United States was one of the earliest social welfare reforms of the Progressive Era. The first juvenile court law was passed in Illinois in 1899. Within a decade twenty-two other states had passed similar laws, based on the Illinois example. Mothers of All Children examines this movement, focusing especially on the role of women reformers and the importance of gender consciousness in influencing the shape of reform. Until recently historians have assumed that male reformers dominated many of the Progressive Era social reforms. Mothers of All Children goes beyond simply writing women back into the history of the juvenile court movement to reveal the complexity of their involvement. Some women operated within nineteenth-century ideals of motherhood and domesticity while others, trained in the social sciences and living in,the poor neighborhoods of America's cities, took a more pragmatic approach.Despite these differences, Clapp finds a common maternalist approach that distinguished women reformers from their male counterparts. Women were more willing to use the state to deal with wayward children, whereas men were more commonly involved as supporters of women reformers' initiatives rather than being themselves the initiators of reform.Firmly located in the context of recent scholarship on American women's history, Mothers of All Children has broad implications for American women's political history and the history of the welfare state.",UCSD:31822026261263,False,False,232,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uqAGCD2V8yQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1998

bnCMBAAAQBAJ,history,Dynastic China,An Elementary History,Tan Koon San,The Other Press,"Dynastic China: An Elementary History surveys four millennia of China’s history. It traced commentaries from the mythological period of Pangu, creator of the Chinese universe, and the Goddess Nuwa, creator of the Chinese people, through to the legendary periods of the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties to subsequent succeeding dynasties from the Qin Dynasty (221 BC) to the end of the Qing Dynasty (1912 AD). It weaved through brutal political intrigues and conspiracies of China’s imperial existence. The persistent enthronement of child emperors for the benefits of power-hungry eunuchs, dowagers, members of the imperial clans, generals and warlords formed a large part of the narrative. Encrypted within are salient elements of Chinese philosophical precepts, civilisation values, and political ideals. The core concepts that mould the idea of tian xia 天 下 (all under heaven) and tian ming 天 命 (Mandate of Heaven), and how these guided Chinese perception of their world are painstakingly explained. The profound influence of Confucianism and the functional adoption of the Legalist framework in statecraft are imparted in the context of practicality and idealism. So too is the complementary notion of natural dualities, the Yin-Yang (阴 阳) harmony of contradictions. How these filtered through from philosophy to cultural values are deftly introduced. Imperial obsessions with frontier threats are also incisively presented. So are the diplomatic statecraft of matrimonial kinship, tributary exchanges and military engagements adopted to conduct relations. China’s perception of people in the frontier region are insightfully described. The application of the Chinese character yi 夷 to refer to them, it seems, carries a more gracious nuance to mean “of a distinct or different nature” and not the offensive attribution of ‘barbarian’ as made out in western notion. This and many more distinctions in discernment of the Chinese mindset are perceptively elucidated in the book.","9789839541885, 9839541889",False,True,535,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bnCMBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2014

VwpbEAAAQBAJ,history,Women in World History,1450 to the Present,Bonnie G. Smith,Bloomsbury Publishing,"Women in World History brings together the most recent scholarship in women's and world history in a single volume covering the period from 1450 to the present, enabling readers to understand women's relationship to world developments over the past five hundred years. Women have served the world as unfree people, often forced to migrate as slaves, trafficked sex workers, and indentured laborers working off debts. Diseases have migrated through women's bodies and women themselves have deliberately spread religious belief and fervor as well as ideas. They have been global authors, soldiers, and astronauts encircling the globe and moving far beyond it. They have written classics in political and social thought and crafted literary and artistic works alongside others who were revolutionaries and reform-minded activists. Historical scholarship has shown that there is virtually no part of the world where women's presence is not manifest, whether in archives, oral testimonials, personal papers, the material record, evidence of disease and famine, myth and religious teachings, and myriad other forms of documentation. As these studies mount, the idea of surveying women's past on a global basis becomes daunting. This book aims to redress this situation and offer a synthetic world history of women in modern times.","9781474272926, 1474272924",False,False,337,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VwpbEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2020

GAiAswEACAAJ,history,The History and Literature of the Crusades (Classic Reprint),,Heinrich Von Sybel,Forgotten Books,"Excerpt from The History and Literature of the Crusades The first part of the work now submitted to the public, is a translation of the lectures delivered at Munich; the second part is taken from the preface to his History of the First Crusade, published in 1841 and consists of an elaborate criticism on the various original authorities in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and on the later historians of the Crusades, down to the present time. There exists, we believe, no such critical examination of the ori ginal authorities in any other language. The refer ences to them in Mills's History of the Crusades are somewhat meagre; while\ Michaud, although in his Bibliotheque des Croisades he has given ample extracts, has nowhere subjected the originals to the rigorous and minute analysis they undergo at the hands of the German Professor. The first impulse to a critical examination of the original authorities of the First Crusade was given by Professor Ranke in his Historical Exercises He began with the first books of William of Tyre, which he proved to be merely a repetition of earlier accounts by Albert of Aix, Ray mond of Agiles, and from the 'gesta Francorum.' He then examined Albert of Aix, whose work he considered to be derived chieﬂy from oral tradition. Professor Ranke's other avocations prevented his pursuing this subject any further; but sufficient was done to clear the way for other historical stu dents; and v. Sybel has carried out the method of his eminent teacher. The narrative of the First Crusade, as given by Mills and other modern historians, v. Sybel re gards as a mingled mass of truth and falsehood, of history and legend, founded chieﬂy on the account of William of Tyre. William of Tyre wrote in 1170, and with much that was valuable, he mixed tales borrowed from Albert of Aix The general character of the work is thought by the German Professor to be poetical and legendary.

A book on the history of machines is nothing more than a specific way of bringing light to human events as a whole in order to highlight some significant milestones in the progress of knowledge by a complementary persp- tive into a general historical overview. This book is the result of common efforts and interests by several scholars, teachers, and students on subjects that are connected with the theory of machines and mechanisms. In fact, in this book there is a certain teaching aim in addition to a general historical view that is more addressed to the achievements by “homo faber” than to those by “homo sapiens”, since the proposed history survey has been developed with an engineering approach. The brevity of the text added to the fact that the authors are probably not com- tent to tackle historical studies with the necessary rigor, means the content of the book is inevitably incomplete, but it nevertheless attempts to fulfil three basic aims: First, it is hoped that this book may provide a stimulus to promote interest in the study of technical history within a mechanical engineering context. Few are the co- tries where anything significant is done in this area, which means there is a general lack of knowledge of this common cultural heritage.","9400732104, 9789400732100",False,False,262,Technology & Engineering,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-E2CMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2012

NK9hEAAAQBAJ,history,The Boundaries of Freedom,"Slavery, Abolition, and the Making of Modern Brazil","Brodwyn Fischer, Keila Grinberg",Cambridge University Press,"The Boundaries of Freedom brings together, for the first time in English, key scholars writing on the social and cultural history of Brazilian slavery, emphasizing the centrality of slavery, abolition, and Black subjectivity in the forging of modern Brazil, the largest and most enduring slave society in the Americas. Nearly five million enslaved Africans were forced to Brazil's shores over four and a half centuries, making slavery integral to every aspect of its colonial and national history, stretching beyond temporal and geographical boundaries. This book introduces English-language readers to a paradigm-shifting renaissance in Brazilian scholarship that has taken place in the past several decades, upending longstanding assumptions on slavery's relation to law, property, sexuality and family; reconceiving understandings of slave economies; and engaging with issues of agency, autonomy, and freedom. These vibrant debates are explored in fifteen essays that place the Brazilian experience in dialogue with the afterlives of slavery worldwide.","9781108917025, 110891702X",True,False,505,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NK9hEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2022

He demonstrates how Frederick the Great abandoned this paradigm for a neoclassical vision of history in which sovereign and state transcend time altogether, and how Bismarck believed that the statesman's duty was to preserve the timeless permanence of the state amid the torrent of historical change. Clark describes how Hitler did not seek to revolutionize history like Stalin and Mussolini, but instead sought to evade history altogether, emphasizing timeless racial archetypes and a prophetically foretold future.","9780691217321, 0691217327",False,True,310,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sDwDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2021

BYqeEAAAQBAJ,history,Hell's Half-Acre,"The Untold Story of the Benders, a Serial Killer Family on the American Frontier",Susan Jonusas,Penguin,"One of NPR's ""Books We Love"" New York Times Book Review's ""The Best True Crime of 2022"" ""Rich in historical perspective and graced by novelistic touches, grips the reader from first to last.”—Wall Street Journal A suspense filled tale of murder on the American frontier—shedding new light on a family of serial killers in Kansas, whose horrifying crimes gripped the attention of a nation still reeling from war. In 1873 the people of Labette County, Kansas made a grisly discovery. Buried by a trailside cabin beneath an orchard of young apple trees were the remains of countless bodies. Below the cabin itself was a cellar stained with blood. The Benders, the family of four who once resided on the property were nowhere to be found. The discovery sent the local community and national newspapers into a frenzy that continued for decades, sparking an epic manhunt for the Benders. The idea that a family of seemingly respectable homesteaders—one among the thousands relocating farther west in search of land and opportunity after the Civil War—were capable of operating ""a human slaughter pen"" appalled and fascinated the nation. But who the Benders really were, why they committed such a vicious killing spree and whether justice ever caught up to them is a mystery that remains unsolved to this day. Set against the backdrop of postbellum America, Hell’s Half-Acre explores the environment capable of allowing such horrors to take place. Drawing on extensive original archival material, Susan Jonusas introduces us to a fascinating cast of characters, many of whom have been previously missing from the story. Among them are the families of the victims, the hapless detectives who lost the trail, and the fugitives that helped the murderers escape. Hell’s Half-Acre is a journey into the turbulent heart of nineteenth century America, a place where modernity stalks across the landscape, violently displacing existing populations and building new ones. It is a world where folklore can quickly become fact and an entire family of criminals can slip through a community’s fingers, only to reappear in the most unexpected of places.","9781984879851, 1984879855",False,False,369,True Crime,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BYqeEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2023

VwpbEAAAQBAJ,history,Women in World History,1450 to the Present,Bonnie G. Smith,Bloomsbury Publishing,"Women in World History brings together the most recent scholarship in women's and world history in a single volume covering the period from 1450 to the present, enabling readers to understand women's relationship to world developments over the past five hundred years. Women have served the world as unfree people, often forced to migrate as slaves, trafficked sex workers, and indentured laborers working off debts. Diseases have migrated through women's bodies and women themselves have deliberately spread religious belief and fervor as well as ideas. They have been global authors, soldiers, and astronauts encircling the globe and moving far beyond it. They have written classics in political and social thought and crafted literary and artistic works alongside others who were revolutionaries and reform-minded activists. Historical scholarship has shown that there is virtually no part of the world where women's presence is not manifest, whether in archives, oral testimonials, personal papers, the material record, evidence of disease and famine, myth and religious teachings, and myriad other forms of documentation. As these studies mount, the idea of surveying women's past on a global basis becomes daunting. This book aims to redress this situation and offer a synthetic world history of women in modern times.","9781474272926, 1474272924",False,False,337,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VwpbEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2020

Set in magnificent Renaissance France, this is the story of two remarkable women, a mother and daughter driven into opposition by a terrible betrayal that threatened to destroy the realm. Catherine de' Medici was a ruthless pragmatist and powerbroker who dominated the throne for thirty years. Her youngest daughter Marguerite, the glamorous ""Queen Margot,"" was a passionate free spirit, the only adversary whom her mother could neither intimidate nor control. When Catherine forces the Catholic Marguerite to marry her Protestant cousin Henry of Navarre against her will, and then uses her opulent Parisian wedding as a means of luring his followers to their deaths, she creates not only savage conflict within France but also a potent rival within her own family. Rich in detail and vivid prose, Goldstone's narrative unfolds as a thrilling historical epic. Treacherous court politics, poisonings, international espionage, and adultery form the background to a story that includes such celebrated figures as Elizabeth I, Mary, Queen of Scots, and Nostradamus. The Rival Queens is a dangerous tale of love, betrayal, ambition, and the true nature of courage, the echoes of which still resonate.","9780316409674, 0316409677",True,False,518,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dQC0BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2015

el4_DwAAQBAJ,history,The Cut Out Girl,"A Story of War and Family, Lost and Found",Bart van Es,Penguin,"COSTA BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER “The hidden gem of the year . . . Sensational and gripping, and shedding light on some of the most urgent issues of our time, this was our unanimous winner.” —Judges of the 2018 Costa Award The extraordinary true story of a young Jewish girl in Holland during World War II, who hides from the Nazis in the homes of an underground network of foster families, one of them the author's grandparents Bart van Es left Holland for England many years ago, but one story from his Dutch childhood never left him. It was a mystery of sorts: a young Jewish girl named Lientje had been taken in during the war by relatives and hidden from the Nazis, handed over by her parents, who understood the danger they were in all too well. The girl had been raised by her foster family as one of their own, but then, well after the war, there was a falling out, and they were no longer in touch. What was the girl's side of the story, Bart wondered? What really happened during the war, and after? So began an investigation that would consume Bart van Es's life, and change it. After some sleuthing, he learned that Lientje was now in her 80s and living in Amsterdam. Somewhat reluctantly, she agreed to meet him, and eventually they struck up a remarkable friendship, even a partnership. The Cut Out Girl braids together a powerful recreation of that intensely harrowing childhood story of Lientje's with the present-day account of Bart's efforts to piece that story together, including bringing some old ghosts back into the light. It is a story rich with contradictions. There is great bravery and generosity--first Lientje's parents, giving up their beloved daughter, and then the Dutch families who face great danger from the Nazi occupation for taking Lientje and other Jewish children in. And there are more mundane sacrifices a family under brutal occupation must make to provide for even the family they already have. But tidy Holland also must face a darker truth, namely that it was more cooperative in rounding up its Jews for the Nazis than any other Western European country; that is part of Lientje's story too. Her time in hiding was made much more terrifying by the energetic efforts of the local Dutch authorities, zealous accomplices in the mission of sending every Jew, man, woman and child, East to their extermination. And Lientje was not always particularly well treated, and sometimes, Bart learned, she was very badly treated indeed. The Cut Out Girl is an astonishment, a deeply moving reckoning with a young girl's struggle for survival during war, a story about the powerful love of foster families but also the powerful challenges, and about the ways our most painful experiences define us but also can be redefined, on a more honest level, even many years after the fact. A triumph of subtlety, decency and unflinching observation, The Cut Out Girl is a triumphant marriage of many keys of writing, ultimately blending them into an extraordinary new harmony, and a deeper truth.","9780735222250, 0735222258",True,False,273,Biography & Autobiography,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=el4_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

Sixteen stories are retained from the third edition, including the ""Pioneers of A.A."" section, which helps the reader remain linked to A.A.'s historic roots, and shows how early members applied this simple but profound program that helps alcoholics get sober today. Approximately 21 million copies of the first three editions of ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" have been distributed. It is expected that the new fourth edition will play its part in passing on A.A.'s basic message of recovery. This fourth edition has been approved by the General Service Conference of Alcoholics Anonymous, in the hope that many more may be led toward recovery by reading its explanation of the A.A. program and its varied examples of personal experiences which demonstrate that the A.A. program works.","1893007162, 9781893007161",False,False,576,Self-Help,en,,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2002

With a richness of detail and sweeping breadth of historical examples, he chronicles and analyzes the history of the opposite ideological extremes of Fascism and Marxism and their descent into totalitarianism via secular religiosity. Aron also examines French imperialism through the examples of Algeria and Indochina, as well as America's role as an ""imperial republic"" during and after World War II. Aron was never orthodox in his ideology; neither his republican political penchants nor his dialectical intellectual orientation ever gained the upper hand over his devotion to empirical reality. The result here is an intellectual history that seems less concerned about where it falls on the political spectrum than about getting it right.","9780786748563, 0786748567",True,False,581,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Ac5DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1437.38,INR,718.69,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Ac5DgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3Ac5DgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2009

rfpWCgAAQBAJ,history,Rethinking German History (Routledge Revivals),Nineteenth-Century Germany and the Origins of the Third Reich,Richard J. Evans,Routledge,"In Rethinking German History, first published in 1987, Richard J. Evans argues for a social-historical approach to the German past that pays equal attention to objective social structures and subjective values and experiences. If German history has been seen as an exception to the ‘normal’ development of Western society, this is not least because historians have until recently largely failed to look beyond the world of high politics, institutions, organizations and ideologies to broader historical problems of German society and German mentalities. By applying and adapting approaches learned from French and British social history as they have been developed over the last quarter of a century, it is possible to achieve a rethinking of German history which does away with many of the textbook myths that have encrusted the historiogrpahy of Germany for so long. This book will be valuable for students of German history and politics, and brings together essays widely used in teaching. Its broad coverage of social history will also be useful to all those interested in contemporary historiography or the comparative study of European history.","9781317539636, 131753963X",True,True,341,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rfpWCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,4258.62,INR,4258.62,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rfpWCgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-rfpWCgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2015

This book is a rich resource for those involved in researching the history of computers."" –The Mathematics Teacher In this brilliant follow-up to his landmark international bestseller, The Universal History of Numbers, Georges Ifrah traces the development of computing from the invention of the abacus to the creation of the binary system three centuries ago to the incredible conceptual, scientific, and technical achievements that made the first modern computers possible. Ifrah takes us along as he visits mathematicians, visionaries, philosophers, and scholars from every corner of the world and every period of history. We learn about the births of the pocket calculator, the adding machine, the cash register, and even automata. We find out how the origins of the computer can be found in the European Renaissance, along with how World War II influenced the development of analytical calculation. And we explore such hot topics as numerical codes and the recent discovery of new kinds of number systems, such as ""surreal"" numbers. Adventurous and enthralling, The Universal History of Computing is an astonishing achievement that not only unravels the epic tale of computing, but also tells the compelling story of human intelligence–and how much further we still have to go.","0471441473, 9780471441472",False,False,416,Mathematics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fFdKPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2002

The concept of boundaries is variously defined within linguistics depending on the theoretical framework, from formal and theoretical perspectives to specific fields and more empirical, physical, and perceptual angles. The contributions to this volume do not take one particular theoretical or methodological approach but, instead, explore how examining various types of boundaries—linguistic, conceptual, analytical, generic, physical—helps us illuminate and account for historical use, variation, and change in English. In their exploration of various topics in the history of English, contributions ask a range of questions: what does it mean to set up boundaries between time periods? When do language varieties have distinct boundaries and when do they overlap? Where do language users draw up clausal, constructional, semantic, phonetic/phonological boundaries? Thus, the chapters explore not only how boundaries illustrate synchronic and diachronic features in the history of the English language but also what we can discover by questioning perceived or actual boundaries.","9783110639858, 3110639858",True,True,312,Foreign Language Study,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KK0DEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,13610.99,INR,13610.99,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KK0DEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-KK0DEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020

76DRwgEACAAJ,history,Six Easy Pieces,Essentials Of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher,Richard P. Feynman,Basic Books,"Richard P. Feynman (1918–1988) was widely recognized as the most creative physicist of the post–World War II period. His career was extraordinarily expansive. From his contributions to the development of the atomic bomb a Los Alamos during World War II to his work in quantum electrodynamics, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965, Feynman was celebrated for his brilliant and irreverent approach to physics.It was Feynman's outrageous and scintillating method of teaching that earned him legendary status among students and professors of physics. From 1961–1963, Feynman, at the California Institute of Technology, delivered a series of lectures that revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world. Six Easy Pieces, taken from the famous Lectures on Physics, represents the most accessible material from this series. In these six chapters, Feynman introduces the general reader to the following topics: atoms, basic physics, the relationship of physics to other topics, energy, gravitation, and quantum force. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each discussion without equations or technical jargon.Readers will remember how—using ice water and rubber—Feynman demonstrated with stunning simplicity to a nationally televised audience the physics of the 1986 Challenger disaster. It is precisely this ability—the clear and direct illustration of complex theories—that made Richard Feynman one of the most distinguished educators in the world. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations, Six Easy Pieces is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most admired and accessible scientists of our time.","0201408252, 9780201408256",False,False,176,Science,en,,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1996

To what extent has it succeeded in making women’s history an integral part of academic enquiry rather than an optional specialist area? What impact has the study of manhood and masculinities had on our understanding of women’s lives? What is the relationship between gender studies and new critical histories of colonialism and empire, contact zones, cross-cultural encounters and racialisation? How is new work on cultural geography and spatial categories impacting our historical understandings of bodily differences? The articles collected here are inspired by these questions, previously posed by Karen Offen and Chen Yan to an international group of historians. They discuss several critical themes, including: the challenges the field has experienced in the Italian institutional context and which it continues to face today; how we can move the conversation beyond Italy and Europe to other international arenas; and how to expand the research on topics like the history of masculinities, gay and lesbian studies, colonial studies, and global history.","9788833136196, 8833136191",False,False,121,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1mghEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2020

g63qBgAAQBAJ,history,The Third Reich in History and Memory,,Richard J. Evans,Oxford University Press,"In the seventy years since the demise of the Third Reich, there has been a significant transformation in the ways in which the modern world understands Nazism. In this brilliant and eye-opening collection, Richard J. Evans, the acclaimed author of the Third Reich trilogy, offers a critical commentary on that transformation, exploring how major changes in perspective have informed research and writing on the Third Reich in recent years. Drawing on his most notable writings from the last two decades, Evans reveals the shifting perspectives on Nazism's rise to political power, its economic intricacies, and its subterranean extension into postwar Germany. Evans considers how the Third Reich is increasingly viewed in a broader international context, as part of the age of imperialism; discusses the growing emphasis on the larger economic and cultural circumstances of the era; and emphasizes the development of research into Nazi society, particularly in the understanding of Nazi Germany as a political system based on popular approval and consent. Exploring the complex relationship between memory and history, Evans also points out the places where the growing need to confront the misdeeds of Nazism and expose the complicity of those who participated has led to crude and sweeping condemnation, when instead historians should be making careful distinctions. Written with Evans' sharp-eyed insight and characteristically compelling style, these essays offer a summation of the collective cultural memory of Nazism in the present, and suggest the degree to which memory must be subjected to the close scrutiny of history.","9780190228415, 0190228415",True,False,496,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g63qBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2015

BKjQDwAAQBAJ,history,The American Robot,A Cultural History,Dustin A. Abnet,University of Chicago Press,"Although they entered the world as pure science fiction, robots are now very much a fact of everyday life. Whether a space-age cyborg, a chess-playing automaton, or simply the smartphone in our pocket, robots have long been a symbol of the fraught and fearful relationship between ourselves and our creations. Though we tend to think of them as products of twentieth-century technology—the word “robot” itself dates to only 1921—as a concept, they have colored US society and culture for far longer, as Dustin A. Abnet shows to dazzling effect in The American Robot. In tracing the history of the idea of robots in US culture, Abnet draws on intellectual history, religion, literature, film, and television. He explores how robots and their many kin have not only conceptually connected but literally embodied some of the most critical questions in modern culture. He also investigates how the discourse around robots has reinforced social and economic inequalities, as well as fantasies of mass domination—chilling thoughts that the recent increase in job automation has done little to quell. The American Robot argues that the deep history of robots has abetted both the literal replacement of humans by machines and the figurative transformation of humans into machines, connecting advances in technology and capitalism to individual and societal change. Look beneath the fears that fracture our society, Abnet tells us, and you’re likely to find a robot lurking there.","9780226692852, 022669285X",True,True,385,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BKjQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,756.38,INR,378.19,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKjQDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-BKjQDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2020

But today's conflict is only the latest in a long history of battles over Ukraine's existence as a sovereign nation. As award-winning historian Serhii Plokhy argues in The Gates of Europe, we must examine Ukraine's past in order to understand its fraught present and likely future. Situated between Europe, Russia, and the Asian East, Ukraine was shaped by the empires that have used it as a strategic gateway between East and West—from the Romans and Ottomans to the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, all have engaged in global fights for supremacy on Ukrainian soil. Each invading army left a lasting mark on the landscape and on the population, making modern Ukraine an amalgam of competing cultures.

2ACvDwAAQBAJ,history,The Boundless Sea,A Human History of the Oceans,David Abulafia,Oxford University Press,"From the beginning of history to the present, a sweep of the world's oceans and seas and how they have shaped the course of civilization. From the author of the acclaimed The Great Sea, (""Magnificent . . . radiates scholarship and a sense of wonder and fun,"" Simon Sebag Montefiore; Book of the Year, The Economist), David Abulafia's new book guides readers along the world's greatest bodies of water to reveal their primary role in human history. The main protagonists are the three major oceans--the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian--which together comprise the majority of the earth's water and cover over half of its surface. Over time, as passage through them gradually extended and expanded, linking first islands and then continents, maritime networks developed, evolving from local exploration to lines of regional communication and commerce and eventually to major arteries. These waterways carried goods, plants, livestock, and of course people--free and enslaved--across vast expanses, transforming and ultimately linking irrevocably the economies and cultures of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Far more than merely another history of exploration, The Boundless Sea shows how maritime networks gradually formed a continuum of interaction and interconnection. Working chronologically, Abulafia moves from the earliest forays of peoples taking hand-hewn canoes into uncharted waters, to the routes taken daily by supertankers in the thousands. History on the grandest scale and scope, written with passion and precision, this is a project few could have undertaken. Abulafia, whom The Atlantic calls ""superb writer with a gift for lucid compression and an eye for the telling detail,"" proves again why he ranks as one of the world's greatest storytellers.","9780199934997, 0199934991",False,False,1115,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2ACvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2019

kfAzvgAACAAJ,history,Biodiversity and Earth History,,"Jens Boenigk, Sabina Wodniok, Edvard Glücksman",Springer,"This uniquely interdisciplinary textbook explores the exciting and complex relationship between Earth’s geological history and the biodiversity of life. Its innovative design provides a seamless learning experience, clarifying major concepts step by step with detailed textual explanations complemented by detailed figures, diagrams and vibrant pictures. Thanks to its layout, the respective concepts can be studied individually, as part of the broader framework of each chapter, or as they relate to the book as a whole. It provides in-depth coverage of: - Earth’s formation and subsequent geological history, including patterns of climate change and atmospheric evolution; - The early stages of life, from microbial ‘primordial soup’ theories to the fossil record’s most valuable contributions; - Mechanisms of mutual influence between living organisms and the environment: how life changed Earth’s history whilst, at the same time, environmental pressures continue to shape the evolution of species; - Basic ideas in biodiversity studies: species concepts, measurement techniques, and global distribution patterns; - Biological systematics, from their historical origins in Greek philosophy and Biblical stories to Darwinian evolution by natural selection, and to phylogenetics based on cutting-edge molecular techniques. This book’s four major sections offer a fresh cross-disciplinary overview of biodiversity and the Earth’s history. Among many other concepts, they reveal the massive diversity of eukaryotes, explain the geological processes behind fossilisation, and provide an eye-opening account of the relatively short period of human evolution in the context of Earth’s 4.6 billion-year history. Employing a combination of proven didactic tools, the book is simultaneously a reading reference, illustrated guide, and encyclopaedia of organismal biology and geology. It is aimed at school- and university-level students, as well as members of the public fascinated by the intricate interrelationship of living organisms and their environment.","3662516411, 9783662516416",False,False,0,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kfAzvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2016

Raised by his Sikh mother in Delhi, his father, a Pakistani Muslim, remained a distant figure. It was a fractured upbringing which left Aatish with many questions about his own identity. Stranger to History is the story of the journey Aatish made to try to understand what it means to be Muslim in the twenty-first century. Starting from Istanbul, Islam's once greatest city, he travels to Mecca, its most holy, and then home through Iran and Pakistan. Ending in Lahore, at his estranged father's home, on the night Benazir Bhutto was killed, it is also the story of Aatish's own divided family over the past fifty years.","9781847675538, 1847675530",True,True,337,Travel,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y3lDkkDH_9IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,1150.5,INR,575.25,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y3lDkkDH_9IC&rdid=book-y3lDkkDH_9IC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2009

PjSoDwAAQBAJ,history,Methodology in Sports History,,"Wray Vamplew, Dave Day",Routledge,"The process of converting the ‘past’ into ‘history’ involves engagement with a multitude of different sources and methods, and sports historians inevitably participate in the same debates over approaches and methodologies as their counterparts in other historical disciplines. At its heart, history remains a genre of empirical knowledge that is based upon the remains of the past, and without suitable evidence, there can be no sports history. A burgeoning range of sources has stimulated new ways of thinking and a significant expansion in the sports historian’s evidentiary base, as textual sources have been supplemented by photos, films and cartoons, uniforms, architecture, maps and landscapes, and material culture more generally. This book deals with some of these innovations. It is divided into two sections, the first offering chapter-length studies of particular methodologies, and the second, brief responses from experts in their fields to the question ‘what can sports historians learn from other disciplines?’","9781351727709, 1351727702",True,True,415,Sports & Recreation,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PjSoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,4482.82,INR,4482.82,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PjSoDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-PjSoDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2018

Drawing particularly on the work of R. G. Collingwood, the contributors show that the notion of 'history seen from within' is a viable approach that can be applied in ethnoarchaeology and in both historic and prehistoric archaeology. There is a discussion of short, medium and long-term historical structures in relation to social events generating observed material culture patterning. Examination of the relationship between structure and event within historical contexts leads to insights into the interdependence of continuity and change, and into the nature of widely recognised processes such as acculturation, diffusion and migration.","052132923X, 9780521329231",False,False,160,Social Science,en,,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1987

An eccentric 25-year-old scholar, Knickerbocker relates this comic history of Dutch settlers in the American colony of New Amsterdam, satirizing Dutch-American mannerisms and retelling Dutch legends. Knickerbocker also narrates Irving's story Rip Van Winkle. The word Knickerbocker became synonymous with Dutch Americans in New York state and, later, with all residents of the state. The word also came to describe the knee breeches that characters wore in the original illustrated text of A History of New York............ Washington Irving (April 3, 1783 - November 28, 1859) was an American short story writer, essayist, biographer, historian, and diplomat of the early 19th century. He is best known for his short stories ""Rip Van Winkle"" (1819) and ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" (1820), both of which appear in his collection, The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. His historical works include biographies of Oliver Goldsmith, Muhammad, and George Washington, as well as several histories of 15th-century Spain dealing with subjects such as Alhambra, Christopher Columbus, and the Moors. Irving served as the U.S. ambassador to Spain from 1842 to 1846. He made his literary debut in 1802 with a series of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. After moving to England for the family business in 1815, he achieved international fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., serialized from 1819-20. He continued to publish regularly-and almost always successfully-throughout his life, and just eight months before his death (at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York), completed a five-volume biography of George Washington. Irving, along with James Fenimore Cooper, was among the first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and Irving encouraged American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. Irving was also admired by some European writers, including Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Charles Dickens, Francis Jeffrey, and Walter Scott. Also, as the United States' first internationally best-selling author, Irving advocated for writing as a legitimate profession and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement. Washington Irving's parents were William Irving, Sr., originally of Quholm, Shapinsay, Orkney, Scotland, and Sarah (nee Sanders), both Scottish-English immigrants. They married in 1761 while William was serving as a petty officer in the British Navy. They had eleven children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Their first two sons, each named William, died in infancy, as did their fourth child, John. Their surviving children were: William, Jr. (1766), Ann (1770), Peter (1771), Catherine (1774), Ebenezer (1776), John Treat (1778), Sarah (1780), and Washington.The Irving family settled in Manhattan, New York and was part of the city's small, vibrant merchant class when Washington Irving was born on April 3, 1783, the same week New York City residents learned of the British ceasefire that ended the American Revolution; Irving's mother named him after the hero of the revolution, George Washington.At age 6, with the help of a nanny, Irving met his namesake, who was then living in New York after his inauguration as President of the United States, in 1789. The president blessed young Irving, an encounter Irving later commemorated in a small watercolor painting, which continues to hang in his home.The Irvings lived at 131 William Street at the time of Washington Irving's birth. The family later moved across the street to 128 William St. Several of Washington Irving's older brothers became active New York merchants, and they encouraged their younger brother's literary aspirations....","1985127849, 9781985127845",False,False,188,,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yo3YswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2018

The first part of the book is concerned with the significance of egodocuments, both for the individual him/herself who creates such documents, and also for the other, who receives them. The author approaches the subject on the basis of his own personal experience, and goes on to discuss the importance of such documents for the academic world, emphasizing more general questions and issues within the fields of historiography, philosophy of history, microhistory, and memory studies. The second part of the book is based upon a photographic collection – an archive – that belonged to the author’s grandfather, who over decades accumulated photographs of vagabonds and outsiders. This part seeks to explore what kind of knowledge can be applied when a single source – an archive, document, letter, illustration, etc. – is examined, and whether the knowledge derived may not be quite as good in its own context as in the broader perspective.","9781000472752, 1000472752",False,True,170,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3l5CEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,,,IN,FOR_SALE,True,2465.02,INR,2465.02,INR,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3l5CEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-3l5CEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021

When the British voted to leave the European Union in 2016, the country's future was thrown into doubt. So, too, was its past. The story of British history is no longer a triumphalist narrative of expanding global empire, nor one of ever-closer integration with Europe. What is it now? In Island Stories, historian David Reynolds offers a multi-faceted new account of the last millennium to make sense of Britain's turbulent present. With sharp analysis and vivid human detail, he examines how fears of decline have shaped national identity, probes Britain's changing relations with Europe, considers the creation and erosion of the ""United Kingdom,"" and reassesses the rise and fall of the British Empire. Island Stories is essential reading for anyone interested in global history and politics in the era of Brexit.","1541646924, 9781541646926",False,False,0,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I1aUyAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2020

After tracing the consequences of these historical events for a host of political phenomena, Kamrava gives detailed attention to three pivotal issues: the challenges of economic development, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and the question of democracy.

LzJwzAEACAAJ,history,A History of Development Economics Thought,Challenges and Counter-challenges,Shahrukh Rafi Khan,Routledge Studies in Development Economics,"This book explores the history of economic development thought, with an emphasis on alternative approaches in macro development economics. Given that the pioneers of development economics in the 1940s and 1950s drew inspiration from classical political economists, this book opens with a review of key classical scholars who wrote about the progress of the wealth of nations. In reviewing the thinking of the pioneers and those that followed, both their theories of development and underdevelopment are discussed. Overall, the book charts the evolution of development economic thought from the early developmentalists and structuralists, through to the neo-Marxist approach and radical development theory, the neo-liberal counter revolution, and the debate between new developmentalists and neo-liberal scholars. It ends with an assessment of the state of the field today. This book will be of interest to all scholars and students interested in the evolution of development economics.","0367866498, 9780367866495",False,False,146,,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LzJwzAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2019

Reading Washington Irving's stories along with an array of narratives from local folklore and regional writings, Judith Richardson explores the causes and consequences of Hudson Valley hauntings to reveal how ghosts both evolve from specific historical contexts and are conjured to serve the needs of those they haunt. These tales of haunting, Richardson argues, are no mere echoes of the past but function in an ongoing, contentious politics of place.""The author traces changing versions of several ghostly tales that mutated over time to reflect local conditions and controversies as well as national political issues like abolitionism. Richardson shows that, thanks to the Hudson Valley's long history of settlement, the 'legendizing impetus' created by Washington Irving, and the area's established position as a tourist destination, it inspired at least three sometimes overlapping traditions of hauntings: the 'aboriginal' Dutch and Indian hauntings, the Revolutionary War hauntings, and industrial hauntings, which are traced in Maxwell Anderson's High Tor and T. Coraghessan Boyle's World's End.""-J. J.

Their fast-moving narrative style brings to life the interaction of social and political forces and powerful personalities in a country whose destiny has been determined by its geopolitical situation between Eastern and Western Europe. From the twelfth to the early nineteenth century, Finland was ruled by Sweden, which bequeathed to it Western-style political, economic, and cultural institutions. From 1809 to the Bolshevik Revolution, it was an autonomous Grand Duchy within the Russian Empire with its own parliament, army, and currency. The Finns won their independence in 1917 but had to fight two wars against the Soviets?the Winter War of 1939?40 and the so-called Continuation War of 1941?44?to maintain their freedom. The Cold War presented further challenges as Finland sought to balance its position within the Soviet sphere of influence without succumbing to communist dictatorship. This balancing act was successfully achieved by adroit diplomatic and economic means, with Finland acting as a bridgehead between East and West in both spheres. In the 1960s and 1970s, the country achieved a high level of economic and social development supported by an extensive welfare state and in 1995 voted to join the European Union.","0809391120, 9780809391127",False,False,383,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lbu8QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1999

The approach taken is both thematic, with chapters on the underlying determinants of economic performance, and chronological, with coverage of the whole of the Greek and Roman worlds extending from the Aegean Bronze Age to Late Antiquity. The contributors move beyond the substantivist-formalist debates that dominated twentieth-century scholarship and display a new interest in economic growth in antiquity. New methods for measuring economic development are explored, often combining textual and archaeological data that have previously been treated separately. Fully accessible to non-specialist, the volume represents a major advance in our understanding of the economic expansion that made the civilisation of the classical Mediterranean world possible.","1107673070, 9781107673076",False,False,0,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ENacMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2012
iwI4zgEACAAJ,history,"The History of N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken: Volume 2, A Company of Many Parts",,A. Heerding,Cambridge University Press,"This is the second volume to appear in English of Mr Heerding's magisterial history of N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken, first published in The Netherlands in 1986. It traces the growth and development of the firm from its establishment in 1891 until the retirement of Gerard Philips in 1922. This was a period of dramatic worldwide expansion, and Mr Heerding's vivid account assesses not merely the indigenous factors behind the company's success - notably its production system and marketing expertise - but also the wider technological developments that were shaping the lamp industry generally. Mr Heerding shows how from its earliest days Philips pursued a vigorous export policy bringing it into conflict with entrenched interests in Germany and North America in particular, and was thus able to survive when many of its competitors were floundering. Mr Heerding analyses the long struggle against the German Patentgemeinschaft, and Philips' extensive American involvement, culminating in lengthy negotiations with General Electric: the study provides an illuminating example of how a small company, building on the personal strengths of its founders, can in fact establish itself within a market dominated by monopolies and cartels. As with Volume 1, Mr Heerding provides far more than just the internal history of one company, examining in detail the socio-economic structure of Eindhoven, the Catholic provincial town that was to become the world headquarters of the Philips organisation. He shows how forms of profit-sharing, housing and educational schemes were progressively introduced, as the company, from being a suspiciously watched outsider, became the dominant presence in the town. Sadly, Mr Heerding died shortly after completion of Volume 2 of the Dutch edition: this English impression should make a fitting memorial to one of the foremost Dutch business historians of recent times.","0521321700, 9780521321709",False,False,388,History,en,,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1989

The Babylonians were the first to combine blocks of traditions about primeval time into primeval histories where humans had a central role. In the first millennium there were different versions that influenced the concepts of primeval history within Jewish religion, both in the Bible and in the parallel Enochic tradition. Atrahasis and the traditions of primeval dynasties had crucial impact on Genesis; the traditions of the primeval apkallus as cosmic guardians were lying behind the Enochic Watcher Story. The book offers a comprehensive analytic comparison between the images of primeval time in these three traditions.

Their fast-moving narrative style brings to life the interaction of social and political forces and powerful personalities in a country whose destiny has been determined by its geopolitical situation between Eastern and Western Europe. From the twelfth to the early nineteenth century, Finland was ruled by Sweden, which bequeathed to it Western-style political, economic, and cultural institutions. From 1809 to the Bolshevik Revolution, it was an autonomous Grand Duchy within the Russian Empire with its own parliament, army, and currency. The Finns won their independence in 1917 but had to fight two wars against the Soviets?the Winter War of 1939?40 and the so-called Continuation War of 1941?44?to maintain their freedom. The Cold War presented further challenges as Finland sought to balance its position within the Soviet sphere of influence without succumbing to communist dictatorship. This balancing act was successfully achieved by adroit diplomatic and economic means, with Finland acting as a bridgehead between East and West in both spheres. In the 1960s and 1970s, the country achieved a high level of economic and social development supported by an extensive welfare state and in 1995 voted to join the European Union.","0809391120, 9780809391127",False,False,383,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lbu8QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1999

Saller",Cambridge University Press,"In this, the first comprehensive one-volume survey of the economies of classical antiquity, twenty-eight chapters summarise the current state of scholarship in their specialised fields and sketch new directions for research. The approach taken is both thematic, with chapters on the underlying determinants of economic performance, and chronological, with coverage of the whole of the Greek and Roman worlds extending from the Aegean Bronze Age to Late Antiquity. The contributors move beyond the substantivist-formalist debates that dominated twentieth-century scholarship and display a new interest in economic growth in antiquity. New methods for measuring economic development are explored, often combining textual and archaeological data that have previously been treated separately. Fully accessible to non-specialist, the volume represents a major advance in our understanding of the economic expansion that made the civilisation of the classical Mediterranean world possible.","1107673070, 9781107673076",False,False,0,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ENacMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,2012
iwI4zgEACAAJ,history,"The History of N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken: Volume 2, A Company of Many Parts",,A. Heerding,Cambridge University Press,"This is the second volume to appear in English of Mr Heerding's magisterial history of N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken, first published in The Netherlands in 1986. It traces the growth and development of the firm from its establishment in 1891 until the retirement of Gerard Philips in 1922. This was a period of dramatic worldwide expansion, and Mr Heerding's vivid account assesses not merely the indigenous factors behind the company's success - notably its production system and marketing expertise - but also the wider technological developments that were shaping the lamp industry generally. Mr Heerding shows how from its earliest days Philips pursued a vigorous export policy bringing it into conflict with entrenched interests in Germany and North America in particular, and was thus able to survive when many of its competitors were floundering. Mr Heerding analyses the long struggle against the German Patentgemeinschaft, and Philips' extensive American involvement, culminating in lengthy negotiations with General Electric: the study provides an illuminating example of how a small company, building on the personal strengths of its founders, can in fact establish itself within a market dominated by monopolies and cartels. As with Volume 1, Mr Heerding provides far more than just the internal history of one company, examining in detail the socio-economic structure of Eindhoven, the Catholic provincial town that was to become the world headquarters of the Philips organisation. He shows how forms of profit-sharing, housing and educational schemes were progressively introduced, as the company, from being a suspiciously watched outsider, became the dominant presence in the town. Sadly, Mr Heerding died shortly after completion of Volume 2 of the Dutch edition: this English impression should make a fitting memorial to one of the foremost Dutch business historians of recent times.","0521321700, 9780521321709",False,False,388,History,en,,,,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,1989
